    "I am 41, in UK and have been in perimenopause since age 37. I had a very severe hormone drop two years ago and I am possibly already in menopause (due to severity of symptoms and natural periods stopping completely) but difficult to establish as I've been on Qlaira BCP then HRT. I have been using Utrogestan since June 2024: first orally which led to very bad mental health symptoms, then vaginally which alleviated some of the mental health symptoms but I still do not feel mentally well and it's impacting my life. I seem to have PMDD while on Utrogestan, even when used vaginally. \n\nI still have a uterus so I need progesterone/progestin to prevent hyperplasia. I am not keen to try synthetic progesterone orally. I need to use 4 pumps Oestrogel daily to alleviate joint pain, hot flushes, brain fog, help sleep etc. I tried dropping down to 3 pumps Oestrogel as GP disapproved of 4 pumps, but symptoms got worse, so 4 pumps seems to be what I need. \n\nI am thinking that an IUD (Mirena) may be my best option but I am concerned about side effects. Has anyone had a similar experience and how did you get on with the Mirena? Any side effects? Thanks in advance. ",
  "I am 54.  On my third Mirena.  First to prevent pregnancy and now for progesterone support - I also have an estrogen patch.  My experience has been nothing but…..invisible.  Hence why I just got it re-upped instead of taking it orally.  I know we are all different but it’s worked really well for me.",
  "I’m on estradiol .075 patch, 10mg Imvexxy, and 100mcg micronized progesterone. I feel like I have lost muscle strength and tone and some days I lack energy. Don’t get me wrong, my energy is vastly improved on my current regimen but I’m wondering if a tiny bit of testosterone might help. My doctor didn’t prescribe it and I’m looking for feedback on how you knew you needed it and what improvement you saw.",
  "I hit a wall. Things got better with the patch but I still didn't feel \"normal\". I decided to try T and see if there was improvement. I went to my doc and told her all about my made-up boyfriend and libido issue. I got the prescription and holy moly! It helped so muchore than I was expecting. All my remaing joint pain is gone. My strength and endurance are back. The rest of my brain fog has disappeared.\n\nAdding and fyi: my first 3 days of applying the gel felt like I had just taken the most powerful jolt of caffeine (in a good way) and I cleaned my whole house. Then my body adjusted to the T and after that initial jolt, all the symptoms mentioned just melted away over time and I just feel normal again.",
  "I couldn't feel my clitoris anymore.\n\nIt helped me get that back again.",
  "I asked for it to help with energy and libido. It didn’t fix either of those things really but it made me more calm and logical. I no longer get weird crushes on coworkers. I’m no longer emotional at all really. Just happy and content\n\nI should add that I have gained 10lbs in 2 years that I’ve been on it but it’s all muscle. I work out a lot",
  "No energy for years. Other interventions did not work. Finally got testosterone blood work and my levels were so low they didn’t report back a number. Just less than 3.",
  "Just started testosterone cream (androfeme) and it’s been amazing! Really helping with energy, positivity and cognitive function! Libido is slowly creeping back too but nothing to crazy at this point! My testosterone was very low so thought I’d try it and glad I did. My endocrinologist told me that it doesn’t do much for some people but for others it’s life changing.",
  "Told my doc my energy and sex drive were zapped. He came to the rescue",
  "I talked to my Dr about it from an energy and libido perspective. I was on a compounded cream for a while and my hair started to fall out. I thought it was the T. Upon investigation, I thought it might be iron deficiency instead. I started iron and the hair loss stopped so I asked to try T again. My Dr said I should use the fda approved gel so I did.  It’s working much better than the cream. Only been about 3 weeks but I do have more energy and think even more clearly.",
  "I asked my doctor today and he said he doesn't typically prescribe it for women and in my case it could increase my cholesterol. I'm bummed.",
  "One of my worst symptoms has been the cognitive issues and a general lack of motivation. Only just started E and P, but I noticed my doctor made a particular note of memory loss, and T is included in the hormones to be measured when I get a blood test in three months, so I’ll ask about it then. My levels have always been extremely low. Haven’t actually had any libido to speak of since my second child was born.",
  "Commenting on the muscle strength and tone- testosterone did nothing more for me as far as gaining more muscle than normal when I work out. Women get very small doses, so it’s not going to be like when a man takes T.",
  "Got tested.",
  "My gyn insisted on doing a bl0od t3st for my hormones prior to starting me on HRT.  It came back that my T was well below range.  I didn't know which hormone was causing my fatigue but wondered if T was contributing.  I've been taking 10 mg a day for 2 months and def feel more energized and have better stamina for exercise and workouts.",
  "Fatigue. I’m a very active person, average 12k steps daily and strength training 3x a week, and a little cardio 2x a week. I was tired every day often by noon, losing motivation. My sleep was fine (especially since being on patch and progesterone). I didn’t think I had a libido issue but T improved that too. But yeah my energy and motivation are way better and I feel a lot more like me. I use a topical cream 4mg/ml - 2 clicks per day so I’m getting 0.5ml a day. I started at 1 click and it started to make a difference 5-6 weeks in. I love it!!\nYes a test revealed my free T was quite low. After 6 weeks it was almost double (but not normal yet) and just got tested again after I went to 2 clicks about a month ago, waiting on results.",
  "(Hello, new here. I just used this flair since this is one of the symptoms I have. Saw on TikTok Slippery Elm so started taking them. Don’t know if it’s helping)\n\nJust listened to a podcast with Dr. Mary Claire Harvey.\n\nMajority of the things she talked about are things I didn’t even know I am supposed to expect. \n\nI am 37, females in my family tend to go through menopause at 45. Should I be taking HRT now? What else should I be doing? I am eating high fiber, high protein diet. Exercising. Taking collagen supplements. Started on creatine bandwagon. \n\nPlease prepare me for this. No women in my life is preparing me. All they talked about was hot flashes and nothing else. \n\nHelp! Prepare me please. All the ups and downs. \n",
  "Oh, hon.  Sweet summer child.  You've come to the right place.\n\nHot flashes are one tiny piece of a wild mosaic, pieced together, tile by tile, by Satan himself.\n\nYou can start by reading the \"Menopause Wiki\" on the right hang side bar of this page.\n\nIt is common to hear about 34 primary peri symptoms.  One might experience some, none or all of them.  Often you will cycle through a few at a time.  The peri transition can last from a few months up to a decade. I'm six years in.  I was thriving until age 46, when peri hit me like a freight train.  Many women will tell you a similar experience of feeling great one day, and the next, BOOM, it's like being hit by a truck, all of a sudden you hurt in your joints, you gained 30 lbs seemingly over night.  The mood stuff just descends like a cloud, out of the blue.  Suddenly crying over a commercial or a song. The anxiety.  The stark awareness of the reality of death, and the fear that comes from really understanding the reality of mortality.  The loss of confidence.  The regret.  The boredom.  The burnout.  The intolerance of noise, of bullshit.  The desire to stay at home in your comfiest sweats and do nothing, for months on end.  The strong demand for space and alone time.  The need for rest -- more rest than society permits in this hectic rat race of life.  So much rest that it feels outrageous for a person to need that much rest.\n\nBecause I didn't know about peri, because our Boomer moms did not talk to us Gen Xers about any of this shit, I was sure that I either had cancer, arthritis, fibromyalgia, or Lyme disease.  I took so many tests.  Eventually I realized what was going on, but my marriage didn't survive it.  I have had to say goodbye to young me:  the maiden, the mother.  That door is closed.  I am attempting now to learn who the benevolent crone in the mirror is, with the laugh lines and crows feet and poofy tummy and the long wild curly hair flecked with a gray strand here and there.  I am trying to discern who she is, and what she needs.\n\nBuckle up, buttercup.  It's a fucking crazy journey.  Not for the faint of heart.  No one can understand it until they go through it.  You just can't imagine it, and at times, it feels like a cosmic joke.  But there is meaning in all of this.  Read some buddhist literature.  Pema Chodron, Tich Nacht Hahn, Byron Katie, Alan Watts.  Get into it.  Howl at the moon.  Buy some oracle cards.  Plant an herbal garden.  The best advice I ever got was to \"lean in\" to it all.  Just lean in, and stay curious.  You are becoming the wise elder.\n\n\\[And on a practical note, I think we would all be in agreement that if you can get your hands on some HRT, then do so!  If you are having vaginal dryness then I'd say you are ready for it now.  If you are timid, then least start a dialogue with your doctor, and map out a plan.  There are also several online telehealth sites, if your regular doctor is a dum dum.  But yes, HRT.  You might be able to mitigate or minimize some of the chaos if you act now before shit gets really weird.\\]",
  "I spent my 40s wandering a desert of SSRIs and SNRIs. Turns out, I wasn't depressed, I needed my hormones adjusted.\n\nI'm on patch estradiol, vaginal cream estradiol 0.01%, progesterone 100mg at night, testosterone gel behind the knee every third day in the morning.\n\nIt's a steep learning curve, particularly if you're not used to an in depth personal routine. It had some early successes and a few months of tinkering. But I feel fantastic, and I'm finally able to pursue my personal fitness goals.\n\nHRT reduces all-cause mortality in peri and menopausal women. All-cause means all-cause. Martha Stewart credits her 'slow aging' to HRT begun in her 40s and she is still on it at 83. Sign me tf up, Martha!",
  "My pharmacy is about 2 for 7 on getting my refills on progesterone and my patches.  It’s basically 3 weeks of “we are back ordered”. \n\nAmazon pharmacy says that they have it in stock.  ",
  "Yes, they were the same brand as the ones for my local pharmacy.",
  "Yep and I’ve never had an issue since. Don’t love using Amazon but it is what it is.",
  "My pharmacy benefits require me to use Amazon or CVS mail order if it’s something I take regularly. I use Amazon and it is delivered quickly and without issue.",
  "I am about to start LDN at 0.7mg, adding this to my HRT regimen of the estrogen patch and topical testosterone gel. I was wondering if anyone here has tried LDN, and if it had any particular effects positive or negative. I've heard sleep can go either way, either disrupted or improved. Same with mood. I'm taking it in the hopes of curing an unspecified autoimmune condition that has left me on the edge of a shingles outbreak for almost a year. ",
  "I’ve been on LDN for a long time (for ME/CFS, a neuro-immune condition), in addition to HRT. It’s not cured me but it has reduce pain, reduced insomnia, and reduced some brain fog. I take it at night because it makes a tad drowsy.",
  "It gave me anhedonia. I wasn’t on HRT at the time but I saw no noticeable improvement. Lots of people have good results, so just watch for anhedonia.",
  "&gt; left me on the edge of a shingles outbreak for almost a year.\n\nHow can you tell?\n\nI think the estrogen is keeping my cold sore at bay but I feel the area tingle.",
  "I just want to watch a little tv before I go to sleep and suffer through my night sweats.\n\nSo, why is it so offensive to my husband that I take the remote from him when he is SNORING and obviously asleep.  \n\nWhy the denial? “I’m not sleeping!”\n\nI just don’t get it-it’s every single night 😡",
  "Get yourself a second remote. You can change the show when you notice snoring,  and he will never be the wiser",
  "Men think they own the remote. Until they lose it, then it becomes our responsibility to find it",
  "Get a universal remote and keep it on your side. When the cable installer came, he gave us 2 remotes for every TV and it is glorious.",
  "Girl same. I divorced him. Not because of the remote, lol.",
  "Separate bedrooms has done wonders for my sleep. Highly recommend.",
  "  I almost peed laughing at this. \n\n  I absolutely can't relate, because it's my husband who wants to watch TV, and my asleep ass won't give up the remote...because I'm \"still awake\" \n\n  The I'm still awake is a whole other story, because we now have conservations I have no memory of, because i still feel awake enough to have a conversation.",
  "I know. You’d think it was their penis.",
  "I’m sad that this happens.  Sleep in a different room so you don’t bother the king.",
  "Depending on your tv brand, there might be an app for a remote you can get on your phone (Vizio, Samsung, and the Fire tvs all have them I know). Then you can change the channel when ever you want!",
  "I’m so sorry. It fills me with unspeakable rage when I can’t find a remote. \n\nCurrently, I have 6 remotes to the bedroom TV. My husband complained when I bought more. He can complain all he wants, I don’t give a damn. Those words are for him. I’m going to have a remote when I need one and they get lost all the time in the bedroom. \n\nGet some extra remotes! Depending on your TV, you can use your phone too!",
  "I'm just wondering how long we've shared a husband? \n\nLet's do a custody schedule\n\n(A girl can dream)",
  "My husband said it’s because he is using a certain kind of program like a white noise machine.  He actually said, “because it’s soothing!”  The conversation we just had started out inquisitory, escalated to “never mind,” circled back to”no, I really want to understand,” before the “soothing” explanation.  What I was able to surmise from our ridiculous exchange was that you should just order a spare remote like I did to solve the issue.  Get a glow in the dark sleeve for it if you can :).  You are not alone, sister!",
  "You know, this just gave me an idea. My husband does this too, and claims that he wasn't sleeping. From now on I'm going to take a short video clip of him before I wake him up to prove what I'm saying",
  "The “I’m not sleeping” drives me nuts.",
  "Aw geez, I feel for you! That was me for many years too, until we finally split.",
  "I think every man throughout history has said, \"I'm not sleeping!\" immediately after snoring like crazy.

I quit trying to wake him up to tell him he's missing all the important plot details.",
  "Separate bedrooms are the answer.",
  "Use your phone as the remote. Download the app for the make of your tv. I use mine to turn the tv down in the living room if it’s too loud. \n\nAlso get that man a CPAP and tell him if he’s not nice you’ll shit in it.",

  "For the night sweats, get a chilly pad, I love mine! It’s great. For the tv, get a second remote or if available, download a remote into your phone (Roku has one, don’t know about any others).",

  "I’m 40F and likely going through menopause. Before I talk to my doctor, I wanted to know if anyone had any side effects with HRT? What other the alternative treatment options are available?",

  "Breast pain, acne, weight gain, headaches, constipation, hives, bloating, depression, anxiety, and panic have been my side effects.",

  "Acne!",
  "No side effects for me.",
  "My mother in law experienced significant hearing loss from taking it for around 8 years. She says no one warned her about this. Just mentioning it in case it's still the case.",

  "Zero side effects for me, just overall improvement!",
  "The most commonly used HRT today is natural estrogen and progesterone, the same as the hormones made by your body.  If you have too much of either of these, either made by your body or taken as HRT, you can have problems.  The most common symptom of too much estrogen is breast tenderness, and too much progesterone is a sleepy/dopey feeling.",
  "Much like a lot of medications, it depends on the individual. There are various possibilities. For me, I got a bit of hair shedding, restricted lung capacity/breathing, a bit more drowsiness from progesterone. Estrogen was heart palpitations worsening at times. These might be temporary or not, because it's been only a few months",
  "I just started on the estrogen patch (biweekly) and progesterone pill at bedtime on Feb 12th.  I had anxiety and drowsiness for about 5 days and it went away.  This month I started having breast tenderness and soreness.  That lasted about 2 weeks and it has stopped.  Still don’t know if HRT is working for me yet because I have read it can take about 2-3 months before you feel better. I didn’t have hot flashes or vaginal dryness.  My gynecologist recommended it to see if it helps with my mood, anxiety, irritability, and sadness.  I am also on an antidepressant and started taking it in November.  It helped with the panic attacks but I am still having mild anxiety and sadness ☹️",
  "Just some bloating for a month or two whenever I was adjusting my dose. I am not really complaining about this one but it has also killed my appetite on my current dose which isn’t really a bad thing since I tend to bored eat, but nothing ever sounds good.",
  "What are your symptoms? Are they manageable?",
  "While lots of people do not, there are those who do experience side effects; some find relief when they find the right dose and delivery method, others decide to find other paths through perimenopause.\n\nIt’s a pretty wide field of possibilities, so if you have any specific medical history that might affect things, searching for that in here might help you figure out what is more or less a likelihood for you. Nonhormonal approaches are available, there are prescription medications for specific effects of perimenopause - to learn more about that you might try searching for the specific symptoms that are troubling you, and ask your doctor if that is a good match for your specific health history. Migraines triggered by hormones are an issue that runs in my family, and I have (well had, no ovaries now) PMDD; those both affect how I’m approaching menopause. \n\nOutside of what your doctor can offer, exercise helps many people, phytoestrogens help some people, cutting out caffeine and alcohol helps some people, and getting enough nutrition is good for everyone.",
  "Has anyone done an estrogen pellet over 6mg? I’m thinking about switching to estrogen pellets from injection. Keeping the T injection. But I’m so tired of poking myself so much. Trying to minimize. Anyway, last time I did estrogen pellets I only got a 6mg but it wasn’t enough. They do higher, right? ",
  "Pellets are unregulated hormone therapy, so there's no comparison between dosages or how it's effective once implanted/dissolved.  Compounded hormones are not recommended as a viable or safe treatment option for symptoms of peri/menopause. \n\nAll you can do is try the injection and see how it goes over a period of time.",

  "Like my title says. I'm 56 and I've been post-menopausal for \\~10 years. I just started HRT a couple of months ago and I just noticed my pits smell! This has never been an issue for me no matter how sweaty I got (I have a husband I trust implicitly to be honest about these things). Is this from the HRT?? Anyone else? \n\n\n\nI also quit wearing makeup during the pandemic because I always had a mask on anyway and it was so freeing! It was like being released from this decades-long expensive, time-suck sentence and I was thrilled. But now my face is breaking out and no matter how much I wash it and use salicylic acid and bentonite clay masks, I get deep, cystic, painful acne. I'm so sad. What do you all do about this?",
  "I think it's just a matter of getting to the right hrt dose.",
  "Go to a doctor about the cystic acne. There are some prescription creams that can help. Many of the OTC washes are too harsh for menopausal skin. I suffered for several years in peri with it and never really appreciated how much it knocked my self confidence. \n\nMy GP called it rosacea and gave me a cream that had a topical antibiotic which helped the symptoms a little but stop it and symptoms came back. Then I had a hormonal antagonist shot as I was preparing for a hysterectomy due to fibroids and, boom, my skin cleared up. I fully expected this would be temporary too once my ovaries woke up again but happily it stayed away. I firmly believe mine was fibroid related as it started and got worse the larger the fibroid grew and stopped when they were removed.",

  "Joint pain was the thing that brought me here, and the thing that reconciled me to trying HRT, which isn’t a thing I would typically do. My joint pain improved in *four days*. It is no longer a problem for me that limits movement choices. It’s the estradiol that has that effect; I am on .5 estradiol patches 2x a week, with 100mg progesterone every night purely to prevent my uterine lining from building up with the extra estrogen. All that PT, ice, ibuprofen…*four days*. I had no idea whatsoever that joint pain was connected to dropping estrogen, none whatsoever, and neither did my GP.",

I used to lay in bed while every ounce of my body hurt. Now I am fairly pain free. The GLP-1 is reducing inflammation throughout my body.",
  "Estrogen has made a huge difference in my overall body and joint pain. I quit lifting a few years ago because of it. I discovered Pilates, which has been a great in itself, but the estrogen patch is what really made the difference for me. Recently, I experienced joint pain for a few months off and on and feeling like to my muscles were dried out in formaldehyde. When the anxiety began again, I knew it was time to increase my patch dose. Within two days my joint pain and muscle tightness/pain symptoms were gone. Don't get me wrong, I still have discomfort and take ibuprofen a few evenings a week, but nothing like without the HRT.",

  "Neither my Primary Care Provider, nor the gynecologist will prescribe me HRT. I have tried multiple times and they keep pushing back, mentioning  risks of cancer.\n\nSince menopause started three years ago, I have been plagued with acute depression, anxiety, insomnia and dreadful levels of brain fog, sometimes debilitating. \n\nIncidentally, I am the main breadwinner and can't afford to lose my job. So I have been treating the symptoms: Wellbutrin for depression, micro dose of Seroquel for sleeping. Not to mention the vaginal inserts which still can't prevent all the UTIs. I didn't want to take ADHD medication but I may have to give in...\n\nOn the one hand, my mom did get breast cancer 15 years ago - she is doing perfectly well now and that is the only family occurrence. Doctors know best right?\n\nOn the other hand ... I am getting exhausted and frustrated at how I am being treated as a menopaused woman. Both my doctor and gynecologist know how severe my depression was. And yet they'll keep pushing back without real arguments. I am getting serious doubts as, after all, getting me to consume all this medication is just what the healthcare system is incentived for!\n\nIf you managed to get HRT, how did you do it?\n\n ",

Winona wants to send you the meds from their pharmacy only and insurance doesn’t cover their meds.

The next 6 months were awful: depression, diagnosed with fibromyalgia and brain fog that was overwhelming. I had no idea it was perimenopause, I was 48 and felt like I was falling apart. Started on an antidepressant, changed jobs, began exercising…gained 20lbs. What?!  \n\nI had to find a new GYN when my long time provider retired. On my first visit with her (Sept 2024) we discussed my symptoms - I had been dealing with peri menopause symptoms since 2021 and by early 2024 was post menopausal. She gave me an idea of my options, my homework was to weigh them as well as get my sisters genetic testing results (she’s had breast cancer) in case I needed to get testing done, too. I saw her again in December for follow up and began HRT. It was a relatively smooth process once I had the right doctor.  She’s actively learning and getting certified to help women through menopause and beyond. \n\nI am frustrated for you that your doc doesn’t seem to be listening to you. I had a great relationship with my prior GYN but I’m realizing now she was not the right one to help me move through this next stage. I hope you’re able to find a good fit.",

It started age 36/37.\n\nThe constant cycles of self loathing have stopped, I was on 200mg progesterone orally daily, and 100 evorel patch PLUS 3 pumps of estrogel, I was suffering with awful progesterone intolerance and dreadful low estrogen symptoms still, with a level check to confirm it was low, so last week we fitted a Mirena IUD, and I’ve started on oral estrogen at 1mg. \n\nI’m in the UK, and paying privately to see a gynaecologist, because even the menopause specialist GPs were pretty useless when you throw PMDD into the mix. The final boss is a full hysterectomy but we are trying to avoid anything other than the ovaries and tubes being removed in a few months time. \n\nI’m also using 1cm androfem T cream every other night, and have vaginal estrogen which helps all my GSM greatly. \n\nShe’s asked me to give this dose of estrogen 3 months before we look to change it, but my night sweats are getting more intense already, and I’m so stiff I can hardly walk today. \n\nMy iron, liver, cholesterol, thyroid etc are all perfect, I’m a normal healthy weight.\n\nMy skins like the sahara, I’ve got horrible foot neuropathy and dry eyes. Joint pain and stiffness, brain fog up the wazoo, fatigue and I’m seriously irritable. \n\nI’m expecting some symptoms from the coil, but the joint pains and stiffness are what’s really bothering me, followed by the anxiety and fatigue. Actually I’m full of shit, it’s all bothering me. I’m sick and tired of it.\n\nI’m so unwell I’ve hardly worked the last five months, my mental health is fucked completely and I’m at risk of fibromyalgia down to the constant MSK pain according to the rheumatologist who recently discharged me back to my GP. \n\nI guess I need to either feel I’m justified to push back with the 3 months thing, or if I’m being an impatient twat, I’d rather know. \n\nI’ve been gaslit for so so much of this time and it’s been almost entirely me who’s figured out everything, including the actual initial diagnosis.

  "You won't ever know, and that's okay, because menopause (aka post-menopausal) **is just one day**.  For those with periods it's 365 days (12 full months) after your last period (give or take), and that one day doesn't mean anything.  It doesn't mean that all other symptoms stop then too, and everything goes back to the way it was before.  (For those with periods, that date is only relevant if there's post-meno bleeding, then doctors like to know that date.)\n\nYou can *assume* that at-or-around the age of 48-51 you might be post-meno, as this is the \"average\" age.   (Average is only a rough guideline though, it ranges from 45-60)  But the reality is that symptoms can (and do) carry on long beyond that last period.  \n\nFor instance.... Hot flashes/night sweats can continue long into post-meno and into the 70's or 80s. According to [Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/is-it-normal-for-hot-flashes-to-last-long-after-menopause-begins), studies indicate that 30% of women still had hot flashes 10 to 19 years **after** menopause, and 20% had hot flashes more than 20 years after menopause. The [Study of Women's Health Across the Nation](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2110996) (SWAN), which included 1449 women, found that frequent hot flashes lasted more than 7 years for more than half of the women. Hot flashes/night sweats also contribute to chronic sleep deprivation which affects our long-term health so it's important to seek treatment to improve sleep quality.\n\nSo essentially our bodies are continuing to adapt and change without estrogen as our ovarian function slows and stops.  Being in a menopausal state is for the rest of our lives, and for you, knowing the **exact date you became menopausal** has no bearing on anything.\n\n&gt;how do you know when you need HRT?\n\nWhen symptoms are affecting your daily quality of life, and/or if you know you have osteopenia or family risk of osteoporosis.",
  "Hi I also had hysterectomy January 2023. Nov 2024 I started hot flashes every night every hour on the hour and then eventually during the day for about 6 weeks. 😴 I also had tinnitus, anxiety, itchy ears, meh mood, low motivation, interest, itchy crotch, dryness and ZERO libido. Based on all those symptoms was how my DR determined I was transitioning to menopause! I started HRT January this year and life is SO much better! 💕 My hot flashes came back so I'm moving up in dose. I just turned 50.",
  "I'm 44 and have been in perimenopause. I've been on HRT (estrogen patch and Mirena IUD; I don't tolerate oral progesterone) for around 18 months. I also have type 1 diabetes and hypothyroidism, might be impacting what I'm experiencing.\n\nOver the time I've been on HRT, I've found that symptoms have kept creeping back (especially around sleep) and I've continually needed to up my estrogen patch dose. For the last 6 months I've been on the .1 patch; the \"maximum\" dose.\n\nA couple weeks ago, my sleep disruption--waking up for good at 3:30AM--and hot flashes, and fatigue, have returned. I am so sad and tired and don't know what to do! I have two young kids and am finding it extremely difficult to function and to parent.  Estrogen is really the only thing that's resolved the sleep issue for me in the past, and I don't know what to do now that I've maxed out.\n\nHas anyone here experienced issues despite being on a high/maximum dose of estrogen? And do you have any advice or guidance (other than oral progesterone, which I can't take)?\n\nTYIA!!",
  "That's the maximum patch dose manufactured, not the maximum dose prescribed. Plenty of women use more than that, as absorption varies a lot by person and brand. Personally, I use Climara 7-day patches, one 0.1mg/day patch plus half a 0.06mg/ day patch. Sometimes I use two 0.06mg/day patches. I also use vaginal estradiol, and that can be increased to \"top off\" systemic levels as well. \n\nAlso, a lot of women use a patch plus small dose oral estradiol to top off. \n\nIf your symptoms are returning, you should be permitted to try a higher patch dose and see what happens--to understand if low estradiol is the cause. Alternatively, there's estradiol gel instead of patches, where you could control dosing daily.",
  "Hello!\nA few things I’ve tried that have helped me. My Dr was happy to check my absorption. There’s a few recent studies showing it can be much lower than the actual dose. Meaning you can add extra gel etc \n\nTestosterone is a helpful addition\n\nDepending on where you’re located. Medical cannabis is not to be dismissed as not extremely beneficial. (Uk is also legal for private medical and has been since 2018)\n\nMagnesium! High doses. Helped with sleep a lot for me",
  "My urologist just ordered a lab- blood drawn-to check estradiol. She wanted to see if I am absorbing it through my skin. If not- oral estradiol is an option. Also- I am on testosterone gel- and it helps immensely with fatigue. Also helps pain, inflammation, mood. Prescribed for low libido.",
  "My daughter at 29 has POI, so her ovaries are not producing estrogen. She uses a .1 and a .0375 patch at the same time. You could try using 1 patch and half of another and see if that helps. You mentioned you are diabetic. Do you take a GLP1 like Ozempic or Mounjaro? The combination of a GLP1 and HRT can be very helpful in reducing inflammation, losing weight and improving overall health. My daughter and I both take HRT and a GLP1 and we also have hypothyroidism and we've had to reduce our meds for that as we lost weight. You might want to look into Midi. They prescribe both and accept insurance. \n\nHope you find relief soon!",
  "Have you tracked these bouts to see if they are associated to your own cycles? In peri, because your own hormones are still wildly fluctuating, this can contribute to some highs/lows while using hormone therapy.",
  "Not all people absorb estrogen the same way.\n\nI was surgically menopaused. Patches and pills didn’t work. Estradiol cream did a little for localized issues. Femring works the best.\n\nSometimes they need to try various things to determine which ones works for you. If you’re overweight, for example (like myself), topical estrogen options might not absorb correctly as the estradiol gets converted to estrogen and then estrone too quickly due to the extra fat. Meaning your body doesn’t have enough time to absorb it. It can also happen due to liver enzymes, as this can affect anything absorbed through the liver, meaning your body is breaking it down too quickly sometimes.\n\nTalk with an endocrinologist.",
  "I experience flare ups of my symptoms, but only when the pharmacy insists on giving me a generic version of my patch. When they can't get Dotti, they stick me with Mylan's version and it sucks. Within 3 days, I start having hot flashes and all my joints hurt and I can't sleep. Soon as I can get the Dotti, I'm good again. Wondering if you might be having similar issues.",
  "I always wondered what women do about progesterone when one max patch is not enough...",
  "Does anyone else feel like they want to sleep for a day between their estrogen patches?",
  "I’m never “between” patches, I always have one or two on. Do you take breaks?",
  "I change mine every 84hrs, it seems to help!",
  "So for the last couple of years--closely tracking with onset of peri symptoms--I've noticed my heart rate climbs a lot higher than I would expect during exercise. Ie, a jog where I would expect to be between 130-140 bpm is more like 150 bpm; any high intensity exercise class where I would expect to be 150-160 bpm is more like 170+, which is...really high. I don't feel weak or faint or have any other concerning symptoms during exercise; just the unusually high heart rate. (The only reason I notice is because I'm wearing an Apple Watch to track fitness stats.) \n\nAnybody else notice similar heart rate changes during exercise around peri? Is this normal? I'm trying to stay fit but wondering if this is my body telling me I need to cut back...",
  "Mine has done the same. Not sure why but I’ve been to the doctor for an ECG - not got the results yet.",
  "I had some heart worries, not during exercise specifically, just felt palpitations and  breathless sometimes. Went to the Doctor, got referred to a cardiologist had an ECG, and an Echo, and a 24 hr holter monitor, chest x-ray, ultrasound of my heart etc and everything was normal, nothing to worry about.   \n.  \nIf your able to, go chat with your doctor, and get it checked out. It won't be a waste of your time. It might be something. But if its nothing, then knowing there is nothing to worry about will ease the anxiety of wondering and you'll feel better for it.",
  "For many of us, things like resting heart rate, blood pressure and cholesterol levels increase when we hit meno. Delightful.",
  "Yes I have also had this issue! I never thought it was meno related, but it makes sense!",
  "So I (41F) was finally diagnosed as being in peri in January. This was after 6 months of back and forth with my GP where I was told several times I ‘couldn’t possibly be menopausal as I’m too young’, and was commenced on anti depressants and given a mental health plan for the anxiety and told the brain fog was due to depression. All my other symptoms (joint pain, body aches, weight gain, minor urinary incontinence) were either dismissed or attributed to depression symptoms. It wasn’t until I started getting the classic night sweats and hot flushes that my GP finally agreed to test my hormones and colour me shocked they were consistent with peri menopause (I damn well knew it and raised this several times before then and am still mad I went through the horrendous 6 months I did but that’s a story for another time). I was started on the combined pill (in addition to kyleena IUD I’ve had for 4 years) and within a matter of days I felt like a new woman. Within 2 weeks the anxiety and brain fog were just gone, I was calmer, happier, sleeping better and the hot flushes were briefer and much less intense. However, after 3 months of taking the pill religiously my symptoms have started to creep back in. The sweats are prolonged and uncomfortable, the brain fog is back (admittedly not as bad) and the anxiety is getting difficult to push through again. \n\nMy question is, is this normal? For my body to stop responding to current treatment? Is it something that could be down to whatever remaining hormone cycle I still and will pass or do I need to have my meds adjusted? Do any of you have similar stories? I was so happy when I started the pill and finally had some relief, is this journey of trial and error something I’ve just got to suck up for the next little while? \n\nThanks in advance for your pearls of wisdom..! ",
  "Hello everyone! I hope that somebody can help me answer some of my confusing questions. \n1. First question has anyone primary care physician ordered injections for you guys to self inject? \nIf not! \n2. I know they are online companies, but most have outrageous fees. Who do you guys use and who do you guys recommend? I also would like to get testosterone injections prescribed. \nI am currently getting them from a clinic but I get charged $85 per week which is too much for me to handle right. \n3. Has anyone seen or know is 100 mg per 5ml strength is accurate? I get 1 mg per week IM at that clinic.\nI called CVS and they have like 10 mg, 50 mg 20 mg \nMaybe they don’t have 100 mg\nI would really appreciate your help! \n\n",
  "Not sure about the testosterone dosing, as my hormone specialist believes that testosterone cream is safest for women. \n\nI do estradiol injections. My PCP had no clue what that even means, and multiple OBGYNs didn’t either unless it was for a trans person. \n\nI get mine from a hormone specialist. I think defy medical is an online provider that does both T and e injections. Along with joi and midi. You have to check if they serve your state for the T though.",
  "Hello!\n\nI've been on HFT for about nine months. It started to work immediately and I went from having multiple hot flashes a day/night to maybe one a week. Hooray!\n\nLast fall I started to experience more hot flashes at night and now I'm waking up daily between 2:00 am and 4:00 am very hot. Ick!\n\nI'm not missing doses and I'm still getting some benefit from the HRT (improved mood, no brain fog, no hot flashes during the day) but am curious about these annoying breakthrough symptoms at night.\n\nMy next appt is in a few months but I'm looking for a little wisdom before then. Any ideas?",
  "You might need to increase your dose.   I had to lower my estradiol because my boobs were hurting terribly and now I do get moments where I get too hot but it’s not a full hot flash. Just like a preview of one 🤣.    But I’m willing to have that very occasionally because the boob pain was constant and unbearable.",
  "I was on .0375 for a couple months and the hot flashes came back . Moving up to .05 tonight.",
  "You need higher dose estradiol.",
  "I’m in the exact same boat here. I think your natural hormones continue to fall as you progress from peri into meno, so breakthrough symptoms make sense. Bumping up the dose would be the logical thing here, but the breast pain is not workable. Send your ob/gyn’s advice nurse a msg in the portal if you can’t wait for your appt? Maybe they can adjust something sooner?",
  "Have you lost weight?",
  "I was on .0375 and now I’ve doubled it and wearing two patches until I see my dr again. It’s helped!",
  "Anybody been on both and prefer one over the other? I'm currently on 5mg troches and I'm testing at a level my provider says is good and that I don't need more. But, I'm still really not feeling great during sex. Orgasms are slightly better since starting testosterone but they're a lot of work and only possible with vibrators. I was thinking of asking my provider if I could try testosterone cream instead to see if it helps more. \n\nI recently had sex for the first time with a new partner and I'm feeling some grief about it. The sex was amazing and in my pre perimenopausal body, I would have had about 10 orgasms. In my current body, I never really got close. (It was enjoyable anyhow though.)\n\n(For reference, I'm 48, on a .05 Femring, .05 oral estradiol, 100 mg progesterone and 5 mg testosterone. Started HRT in June 2024 and we've been tweaking my dosages ever since.)\n\nThanks all. I really appreciate this place and everyone here. You all have gotten me through more than you will ever know. 💜",
  "Question, have you had a hysterectomy or not? I only ask because I was on a smaller dose of progesterone but the same amount of testosterone and I felt like the progesterone just created so many issues of not orgasming or feeling sexual. So I went off of progesterone and am about to start only testosterone and I'm feeling so much better already with better orgasms and a higher sex drive. I still have my uterus and I'm only slightly younger at 44.",

  "I’m 65 and went through menopause 14 years ago. First started the cream probably 7 years ago, and at the time a small amount twice a week was enough. Last year I suddenly had a huge problem with discharge and odor that I thought was a yeast infection. Tests were negative and my dr figured out that I wasn’t using enough cream. Now, because estrogen keeps dropping with age, I’m using about 1 oz 4 or 5 times a week, and that barely controls the symptoms. Just sharing my experience in case it’s helpful. In my case the amount and frequency definitely had to be adjusted due to my age.",

I was on 200mg progesterone prior to my hysterectomy and it helped with my excessive bleeding enough so I could leave my house.",

Started with 200 mg of progesterone last year in January which helped with crazy heavy periods, but my other disabling symptoms did not get better until I started estradiol patches in August of last year.

  "I have been on HRT for almost a year, but had my dosage increased about 3 months ago. Prior to that increase, I only had very sight spotting once or twice while adjusting. With the increased dose (Estradot 100 and progesterone 100mg), I had no issues for the first couple months but then near the end of the third month, I started spotting for a couple days and now am having a full-blown bleed. I would liken this to a full period with clots. My gynaecologist did advise me that spotting or even bleeding is completely normal when adjusting to a new dose, which I understand. I guess I was a bit startled to see actual clots and what would have been a full, normal menstrual bleed back when I was menstruating! Just wondering if others have experienced this? I sort of thought it might be more like just heavier spotting/flow. \n\nEdited to add question: how long should I expect this bleeding to last? Like a ‘normal’ period lasting 5-7 days? More? Less? I did NOT miss this, ha ha. \n\nOther info: \n-50 years old, last menstrual period in 2021\n-HRT since May 2024, started with combined patch then switched to estrogen patch with progesterone capsules in late December 2024 (to address ongoing fatigue and brain fog)\n\nThanks, everyone!",

They need to know in black and white that it’s not them, it’s menopause. But you also need to take steps to make it better for you too. If you’re not on BHRT, start soon. If you’re on it, something needs to be tweaked. Our sexuality is not just about pleasing our partners. It’s very tied into our own self esteem and how we perceive ourselves. A healthy sex life, with it without a partner, is an integral part of taking control of our own happiness and living a fulfilling life.

  "https://menopausewiki.ca/\nHormones are interesting and the more knowledge one can gain insight from the better. A woman’s hormones decrease after we are finished with birthing babies and are unbalanced with menopause on the horizon. \n\nI personally don’t have any recommendations for books that cover libido specifically. I learned about hormones due to having a partial hysterectomy in my twenties. I had PCOS and was a DES baby. The lack of care in a male dominated medical society is astounding. In the books, pod casts and forums libido is also discussed. \n\nBalancing my hormones thyroid on down to Testosterone, estrogen and progesterone has made improvements in many areas in my wellbeing. My libido is great in my sixties. Brain fog, stronger bones, hot flashes, help with stronger vaginal skin to help prolapse bladder. \n\nThere’s a lot of excellent information on the main page under “ community information “ the admins have done a great job and service to us in menopause.\nI’ll post the Wiki here because so many don’t utilize this valuable resource. \nhttps://menopausewiki.ca/",

Also, sometimes I want to feel connected to him but don't want intercourse so we just roll around naked, kiss, and do mutual masturbation.  There is no pressure or expectations to do anything specific, we just go with the flow.",
  "I hope that someday women won’t view a declining libido as necessarily problematic. It’s absolutely possible to find joy and pleasure in life and partnership without intercourse. There is nothing wrong with seeking treatments to make sex less painful / rekindle desire but there should also be more discussion around the possibility that it might also be totally fine not to do that, or to have done that and, as you’ve described, not had it work out so well. Instead of feeling bad about it, there might be a way forward in which a woman can embrace being a vibrant, empowered, and integral member of society even if she isn’t continuing to be a sexual being. It doesn’t mean she hates sex or never had a fulfilling sex life. Just as we wouldn’t wish a prepubescent girl to want to engage sexually, maybe we should also consider that a menopausal woman might wish to not have to seek medical interventions that allow her to continue having sex, if that’s what she wants, and feel not just ok about it but empowered. \n\nWe live in this strange moment that in many ways is trying to overcorrect the wrongs of the past, when women’s desire was negated. I get that. But in the process, we’re making women who’ve tried everything and still can’t seem to wanna get jiggy like they did in their 20s, feel like there’s something wrong with them. There isn’t! It’s “natural” (to use a triggering word) not to want to have sex after a certain age! It’s ok to choose to be ok with that, or not to be ok with that. Both are good. \n\nAs for your husband, if he is unwilling to educate himself about menopause and insists on taking it personally, I’m not sure what might help him. That must be very frustrating and painful for you both and I hope a way presents itself that will allow him to feel compassion for what you’re going through. Sending hugs.",

There are many current ones to choose from since menopause is finally having its moment thanks to GenX and social media. \n\nIt won't get better without both vaginal estradiol and testosterone.

I have been on HRT for five months and the mini-pill for nearly three months and have been bleeding so much. My current period started on Feb 27...I don't mean spotting, I am properly bleeding. I don't know what to do.\n\nI was on the NuvaRing previously and it regulated my cycle perfectly, but was switched onto the mini-pill when I went on HRT because I was too old for NuvaRing, and that's when the bleeding started. I don't even know how to track day 15-26 of my cycle for the progesterone because I am not having cycles that I can make sense of.\n\nShould I just stop taking the mini-pill? I think that's what's causing this because I wasn't bleeding endlessly before I started it. Or should I raise my patch dosage to 75/100 (by wearing 1.5 or 2). I don't feel like I can wait for the doctor. I have a phone appointment with a doctor in more than two weeks time and can't get anything sooner.",

Turned it on if I woke up too warm.  This part doesn’t last too long.",
  "Notably, peri started for me with excessive bleeding at 53. Next came night sweats that escalated over the year in frequency and intensity. By 54, I had other common peri issues too. HRT completely resolved hot flashes and some other issues, but it didn’t make a dent in vaginal dryness and reduced night sweat intensity (by 85% reduction in intensity but nightly frequency remains.)

I thought maybe coming off of everything might return some feeling. What ensued was a nightmare of vaginal atrophy and severe pain which made the desire for intimacy vanish altogether.\n\nI embarked on vaginal hormone therapy which has returned some tone but the pain is still there. Originally I was given an estriol/progesterone vaginal cream. A new provider added testosterone to it which seemed to help the pain the most, but when she wanted to up the testosterone she split it out as a separate topical and I don’t think the results were as good. Yet another provider split everything out, testosterone topically, estriol/estridiol topically and progesterone orally.

  "I know everyone is different, but I’m wondering what everyone’s period was like the last few times they got it? Mine has been changing tremendously, very light but spotting every other week. I have dull pain in my ovary that feels like it’s puttering out. \n\nI don’t know it’s the end but would love to hear from all of you to see what your experience was like. \n\nWould love to understand if this is my new normal or if I’ve finally nearing the finish line. \n\nXo",
  "All ‘normal’ then I went 11 months without anything, then 1 great big, enormous, shark attack like bleed that hurt like the sun itself was sitting inside my uterus. I was literally just laying in bed with a black towel under me for the worst 3 days of my life. Then it stopped and nothing since for 15 months. I have suffered from Endo my entire life but nothing prepared me for the pain of the last one. I’ve not had a second of pain since. The female body does some weird shit!",
  "I think mine got lighter and further apart, and then just quit. Hard to remember, just kind of glad to be done.",
  "Mine got lighter (used to call them “whisper periods”) then nothing for 364 days then a “normal” heavier period for 6 days. Nothing since then (about 3 months ago). \nThere is no “normal” in menopause. Every single woman will be different.",
  "I've been having something similar to what you describe, light spotting every other week or so, and it's been going on for months (sometimes I get a proper period here and there, but it's been mostly this weird pattern of \"mini cycles\"). How long have you been like this?",
  "I had a monster period over Thanksgiving - I’ve never bled like that before. Also leading up to that period I was getting insane cramps on the first couple of days where I was almost unable to go about my business. Since that one I have had random spotting and a few hours of those bad cramps here and there but no more than maybe 8 hours of actual bleeding a couple of times. So I essentially have not had a real period since November. \n\nAlso my libido disappeared, sometimes I get hot flashes that wake me up and my joints hurt bad. This started in prob Jan - the joint paint I’ve had for a while but the other two things I never had issues with.",
  "My last handful of periods were several months apart (last two were 6, then 7 months from the previous), but each one was like a red, clotty flood.  Like my body was making up for those lost months.  I'd have to get out of bed at least 2x during the night just to avoid destroying the bed while wearing super tampons + overnight pads.  Couldn't really leave the house for the first 3-4 days either.",
  "I haven’t had one in 4 months and have actually only had 2-3 in the last year but the one from 4 months ago lasted 69 days with heavy heavy bleeding. I’m hoping it’s the last hoorah for periods!",
  "I had my last heavy period last September I was driving my daughter to the store and by the time we got there I had soaked through my pad and my clothes, next month was thankfully lighter then I skipped them all till this month I got it but it was very light and on on and off for 12 days .",
  "In the past few weeks I have noticed that after I eat ice cream that I get gassy and end up with a stomach ache and sometimes diarrhea. I learned that lactose intolerance can start up later in life but that menopause can bring it on as well. \n\nI. Am. Not. Amused. \n\nAll I wanted was a little treat after a long day of living in this current dystopian world and what do I get? Raging farts and stomach aches. \n\nMake it stop. 😑",

The gluten free ones taste like the originals because let's face it, they're all chemicals.",
  "I took lactase with dairy for around 6 months and then found I didn’t need it again. Might not be permanent if you avoid the upset for a while",

  "Just get some Lactaid tablets.  Take 1-2 when you eat high lactose foods.  They work great!\n\nCoconut milk products are really good -- ice cream and yogurt.",
  "Yes Lactase 9000 is a really good tablet to take too. My son has to take it before anything with milk in. It’s just a pity they don’t have a pill for Gluten free folk like me. I must admit though I don’t have any dairy either now EXCEPT for cheese, you just can’t not substitute Cheese. 🧀",
  "I became gluten intolerant. Not fun.",
  "For me that was the case. I developed a milk protein allergy at 52. And let me   tell you from learning the hard way — non-dairy (e.g., non-dairy creamer) does not equal dairy free. Beware. 🫠",

  "This happened to me when I first entered perimenopause. It went away eventually, actually, but I did cut out dairy for a few years. I cut it out entirely and then added back in Greek yogurt, slowly— just a little bit each day until I could finally tolerate cheese and milk, etc.. \n\nsomething else that I did along the way that may have solved my issue is I fixed my iron deficiency and started taking vitamin B5, which helps your body process sugars. Something to consider.",
  "Yeah.  You’ll make it stop by stopping eating ice cream.   Find an alternative, there are lots nowadays.",
  "I'm in perimenopause and on Utrogestan. I started with luteal phase only and take it from day 14 for 14 days. My period is somewhat irregular can start after 26 or 35 days. Once it disappered for 90 days and I even gave up on the progesterone. I was on the combined pill for over 20 years due to dysmenorrhea since puberty. I tried stopping the  pill few times but the pain and vomiting were unbearable so would go back on it. I suspect I had estrogen dominance. No signs of endo or adeno. In my 40s I decided to stop the pill for good. At the same time I discovered I had high blood pressure so put on meds. My periods are still painful and heavy during first few days but the throwing up stopped. I manage the pain with a codeine+paracetamol combo and buscopan. My mood swings are concerning though. I get angry, irritable or impatient quite fast. Also struggle with motivation and just feel very unlike myself. I regularly wake up to pee or for no reason at all around 2-3am and can't go back to sleep until 6am or later. My hormone tests done in luteal phase showed normal estrogen but slightly low progesterone. But I suspect estrogen levels reducing with age is what made my dysmenorrhea less severe. I'm scared to take any form estrogen though due to HBP and cancer risks. Does estrogen help with mood swings or insomnia? What else can one with HBP try? My other question is if I take progesterone continuously without stopping will I ovulate and can taking more help with moods? So far progesterone has helped with breast pain before my period but doesn't seem to have any positive impact on mood. I do take Osteocare which had Vitamin D, calcium, zinc and magnesium. ",
  "Yes estrogen can help with your sleep and maybe mood swings- everyone is different. You can use transdermal estrogen if you have high blood pressure (patch or gel). No one can say if you'll ovulate- peri menopause is your body starting to slow down and eventually stop ovulating.",

  "I am crossing topics here but hoping for help all over.   I am on my 8th week of compounded tirz. I have lost 20 lbs. 55f 5ft SW 201 CW 181 goal 130ish. I’m taking 3.5mg and it’s working well. No side effects and really good appetite suppression. Now for the sucky part. Before starting tirz for nearly a year I think I have been on hrt. .1 estrogen patch and 100 mg progesterone. Well for several months even before tirz, I have been randomly bleeding. At first didn’t think much of it cause thought could be normal. Well it was getting worse so looked it up to find not normal. Common but needs looking into. Well now I’ve had a sonongram and they see my lining is too thick. Now I need a byopsy to figure more out. There are scary things and not scary things but of course one is the possibility of hysterectomy. I don’t know what’s gonna happen and I’m doing so well so far. I don’t know how long I would need to stop tirz before the surgery? Would they let me start back up right away? I guess I’m putting the cart before the horse but just worrying. Oh also I have been told to stop all hrt for now til byopsy. So hopefully the hot flashes don’t start back up. Ugh. 😤 ",
  "Take a deep breath, it’s going to be ok. 🫶\n\nCongrats on the weight loss! We’re about the same height and goal weight. \n\nTalk to your provider about the tirz. Some want you to stop 1-2 weeks in advance. Some are ok with a liquid diet 1-2 days before. The research is constantly changing so every anesthesiologist has their own preferences. Just follow what they suggest. You may have to tell them you’re on a GLP-1 like Ozempic or Mounjaro because I’ve specifically told them Zepbound before and they’ve looked at me like I had 3 heads. In most cases, I’ve never heard of anyone not being able to resume immediately after a procedure (unless they had some sort of dietary restrictions of course. But again, that’s a question for your provider). It’s a long-held tradition in the Zep community to eat and then take your shot after your colonoscopy though. 😂\n\nCan’t help on the HRT front. Hopefully the hot flashes behave. I highly recommend a neck fan ($20ish on Amazon, can probably find one with overnight shipping) if they do come back. \n\nThe biggest of internet hugs to you.",
  "I've been on HRT for almost 2 years now and on zepbound for about 7 months. \n\nI haven't had anything like this happen. I had an ablation (NovaSure) in my late 40s so that could be why. \n\nBut you may get more answers on this specific question in one of the GLP-1 subs.",
  "Does it seem odd that I was only give T as a pellet and told that estrogen is safest as a pill and best absorbed that way. They also said I was at zero or near zero hormone levels but only gave me a .05 estradiol prescription and said to take half of that to start. Which seems really low. It seems like they at least should have offered the patch. My last period was in January due to being on the pill. They said I’m in full menopause. They also prescribed spironolactone which I am afraid to take because it will block the T (maybe?). This is a OBGYN who is supposed to specialize in hormones. I just don’t trust doctors. ",
  "Pellets can be unpredictable so the spironolactone may be to balance those levels so they don’t suddenly dump too high a dose into your system? I dunno, that’s a new one for me. The estradiol pills are throwing me off too, the patch is way more common these days. Were you also prescribed progesterone?\n\nHow did they determine you’re in full menopause if you last had a period 2 months ago?",
  "Any Doctor who prescribes pellets should not be trusted.",
  "I am probably not the brightest person here.. but how do they know if you’re in full meno if it’s only been January since your last period? Because of the low horm0ne levels?",
  "This provider sounds like an idiot. What blood test was done to confirm you’re in postmenopause? I thought there weren’t any that do this for sure. Oral estrogen  has cardiovascular risks while patches are not known to have such risks. And what about progesterone to protect you from uterine cancer unless you do not have a uterus? Plus oral P helps with sleep for many and that’s true without a uterus. Finally, the T pellets work for some but others say they get way too much from them or the output varies problematically. I have no idea how to find a good pellet provider as opposed to a shady one. I do compounded injections and am moving to FDA regulated generic Androgel, though the injections have worked just fine.\n\nAs for the 0.05 estradiol patch, I had lots of peri symptoms and started at 0.037 patch. Ultimately got to 0.1 patch but 0.037 was a reasonable starting place. Since E &amp; P carry cancer risks I figure the lowest possible dose needed what to go for …\n\nI did maximize my outcome as best I could on E &amp; P alone and then turned to T for libido and to my surprise, it also helped with energy, mood, and stopped the last of the brain fog. So I have no personal experience on how to figure out E, P &amp; T all at once. I suspect other women here do though.",
  "I was on Mimvey as HRT for about 3 years with no issues. In December I started bleeding (one day spotting, then true period-like than back to spotting etc) for 6 weeks. My obgyn switched me to the estrodiol patch and 100 g Progesterone. \n2 questions. First, would this combo be likely to make me gain weight? I've gained about 15lbs this winter (admittedly I haven't been able to exercise because I've had both hips replaced.  But I eat healthy and watch portions.). Second, would one or the other hormone make me cough? I'm fine all day until about 4, and I have a tickly dry cough until I go to bed. It's gone during the night, I don't think I cough at all. \nI have a call in to my gyno, but thought I should go into the conversation with her well-armed. Thanks!",
  "A dry cough means declining estrogen.",
  "I started Estradiol 7 months ago and it helped about 50% of my symptoms, 4 weeks ago I started testosterone injections and it’s already helping on the other symptoms immensely. But, I still have zero libido. I had a few glasses of wine the other day and figured I could give sex a go with DH since it’s been 10 weeks since we’ve done it. Two days later and there’s discharge and blood, not a lot and not menstrual. Is this my new normal? What can I do to prevent this?",
  "I'd go see your dr, it could be so many things.",
  "Are you using a topical vaginal estrogen or DHEA product? If not, that’s what I would suggest. Sounds like some atrophy of your tissues and the blood could be from abrasions and the discharge an issue with pH disruption after sex. Loss of estrogen makes it harder for our vaginas to maintain proper pH, especially when things like semen are introduced. Systemic HRT is usually not sufficient to prevent atrophy.",
  "Could be vaginal dryness. After menopause it can happen after sexual activity. You could also have a thickened uterine lining/polyp or something. \n\nWhen you see your gyno they can order an ultrasound to look.",
  "I have random bleeding all the time ever since I started taking the estrogen cream. I do the bioidentical kind",

And that's even when wearing a pantiliner. \n\nSometimes I can sort of discreetly shimmy and scootch to try to wipe where I was sitting with my pants/butt cheek. But sometimes, mainly if I'm straddling the bench, I hop up and there's my wet spot loud and proud.  She's totally professional and just wipes the machines down without saying anything. \n\nWouldn't bother me if it was just me, but somebody else seeing my juices is kinda embarrassing. Normal or am I just gross? ",
  "I always use a towel. Sit on the towel! Problem solved.",
  "Is there any reason for not putting a towel down before you use the machines? It is a requirement at the three gyms to which I belong. ",
  "We all\nLeave sweat stains on the bench. This is normal and not even menopause related",
  "Sweat from all the places is normal when working out. I wouldn't think anything of it. I do use a towel, though, too, even at home.",
  "I mean, you ideally should be using a gym towel anyway. It’s a requirement at mine. And they also provide wet wipes and sanitiser and paper towel all over the gym.",
  "I literally go to the gym expecting to sweat and couldn’t care less if I leave sweat marks after. Which I always do. But ofcourse I make sure to clean them up after doing sets. I’m sure your personal trainer understands this. I wouldn’t sweat it hehe",
  "You don’t use a towel on the equipment? It’s pretty standard practice at my gym.",
  "Ugh sorry but this is another reason I do weights at home. To save other people from my farting and so I don’t have to touch communal equipment with questionable cleanliness.",
  "Put a towel down and sit on it",
  "This is why you see people carrying small towels around the gym. Get one and use it, sit on it. \n\nAnd it's not your \"juices.\" It's sweat, pure and simple.",
  "I leave sweat on every seat I sit on at the gym and I'm not embarrassed about it.  I sit in other people's sweat sometimes.  It's just a byproduct of working out.  I shower when I get home!\n\nBut a towel is an option if this really embarrasses you.",
  "My gym asks everyone to wipe equipment after use. They provide 'blue roll' (paper towels) and spray to do this, I take a dishcloth rather than use up the paper towels.\n\nI have to wipe anything I sit on because I always leave a little sweaty patch behind ...",
  "I’ve had this my whole life. I just sweat a lot. I can just be sitting, not working out even. Was embarrassing at school living in a tropical climate, plastic chairs and no air conditioning. I just do the shimmy and wipe it off with my butt. I’ve mastered the art 😂\n\nIf I wear full coverage period undies that works too, but those weren’t invented when I was younger.",
  "I really can’t tell if you mean pussy or booty or if it’s an amalgamation for the pussy-booty area!  \nUse a towel, either way.  No biggie.  \nIf it’s vaginal fluid and not sweat that’s a big sign of atrophy so look into vaginal estrogen cream.",
  "I have zero libido. I have no desire for sex. It’s almost like I have no feeling down there. I’m dry and sex hurts. I never turn my boyfriend down for sex because it is an important part of our relationship. Lube doesn’t really help. I’ve tried many. I can’t take HRT due to a past history of hormone receptive breast cancer. My docs agreed that I could insert estrogen cream twice a week, but it’s not making a difference. \n\nAnyway, today my boyfriend said that he had a surprise for me. Turns out, he bought me a new vibrator. I know he’s trying, but no amount of time with a vibrator is going to work for me. He’s excited to try it out. I’m disappointed because I know it’ll do no good. I suppose that it is possible that I haven’t gotten through to him about the severity of symptoms. I’m in for a long, frustrating night. I don’t want to hurt his feelings though. \n\nSorry. Just had to vent. ",
  "That's what doctors don't *want* to understand. Lube isn't doing ANYTHING for zero *desire*.",

I wasnt able to find my happy button.\n2 months in and Its all synching, except I havent tried sex yet, Im so glad for getting excited again and having natural lubrication. \n  Talk with a menopause doctor",
  "I personally needed wayyyy more vaginal estradiol cream to repair the damage. I took Vagifem internal pills that you insert in your cooter, and then topical estradiol cream. It took about 3 months of daily use like this to repair everything that the atrophy had damaged. Now I use it every other day, and my lady business is plump and healthy with its own lubrication and my clit is back",
  "So yes, this could be menopause related, but are you sure? \n\nDoes your boy friend do the things that make you feel loved and cared for? Does he put your needs first in other areas outside of sex?\n\nI’ve read a few posts on this sub where it really wasn’t menopause that led to the zero libido situation. \n\nThe fact that one of your later comments is that his idea of a surprise for you is a vibrator, where you were hoping for something else left me Wondering if he is really listening to you in other parts of your relationship or if he’s missing the mark in general. \n\nAnd it’s ok to tell him if he is. You’re both adults, and should be able to address issues. \n\nI just hate thinking that you feel obligated to have sex. That it’s something you HAVE to do, and not something you actually desire to do for yourself. That really should never be the case. \n\nThe estrogen cream should help with thickening the thinning tissue of the vagina, so sex might not hurt as much, but you should tell your boyfriend it causes you pain. I’m sure he doesn’t want to hurt you. \n\nPersonally, I’ve thought about trying acupuncture to see if that helps the libido - but  I really don’t care about sex anymore. Beyond no libido - arthritis in my hands, knees, and neck, plus general old lady body (stiffness, sagging flesh, and weird noises) all make sex really unpleasant for me. We’ve found other ways to demonstrate love for each other that don’t leave me in pain and discomfort. \n\nHopefully this evening will be a good experience for YOU.",
  "Here's a different approach. I couldn't have sex for a while after prolapse surgery. I told my husband I'd like both of us to pleasure ourselves in front of each other. Of course he went for it right away. I can still orgasm with a suction vibe that focuses on the clit, I can, but barely, my clit has disappeared. We both got off, it was great. We did it again and I asked him to finish on me. Another time I didn't even touch myself but he straddled me, he pleasured himself while i rubbed his perineum and balls, somehow it got me excited and I orgasmed without being touched, by me or him. \n\n  \nI don't know if any of this would help but I thought I would share.",
  "Men don’t get it.  They just keep trying harder and harder.  I have to fake enjoyment, I just want it over.  Why do they keep trying oral……. I want to give you sex but please stop trying to make it better for me.",
  "Girl I feel you so much. Hugs.",
  "I went two years with painful sex.  I finally broke down and tried vaginal estrodiol cream.   I used it daily for 3 weeks, and now I only have to use it twice a week. It has been about two months, and things have gotten way better! I do still use a little lube.",
  "Sort of a devils advocate take… but there are people who just don’t have sex or desire sex who live very full and happy lives. Read up on asexuality… and this is coming from the growing idea that we’ve all been indoctrinated into, that we’re supposed to be paired up with a man and supposed to fulfill his sexual desires.  It honestly, you don’t need a man and you don’t need to have sex to be happy. \n\nYou sound in your message very unhappy and maybe that’s more bc you miss being sexual… but is he pressuring you? Maybe not wanting isn’t wrong. Maybe HE’S wrong. \n\nI don’t know your whole situation, just putting this out there as an alternative idea, just in case. I spent two years post-divorce joyfully single and celibate, indulging in myself and learning new hobbies and meeting new friends and travel. It’s amazing the number of things I can do when I’m not centering my world around a man and his wants/needs.",
  "If they will give you vaginal estrogen, start putting that directly on your clitoris. What I use, that restored the sensation, is a compounded estriol and testosterone vaginal cream. I would recommend something like that. but the caveat for that, at least for me, is that it does bring back sensitivity, I am capable of orgasm and sex but my mind does not care. When I used topical t on my inner thighs for a few months, libido was back and awesome. Had to stop for cost and libido gone again at 44. So sad. \n\nSo get more vaginal hormones if you can and the Dr says it's cool. Also spread what you do have on the outer and inner bits, should help with sensitivity.\n\nEdit, I read your post too quickly. Don't be ashamed of what is happening. I lost the ability to orgasm all together and it devastated me. Share the struggles, explain the situation. He surely won't feel bad for hearing the truth, that he did nothing wrong.

In the review of available research I have done (some clinical and some anecdotal) migraine disorders increase in prevalence in women during perimenopause and menopause, but as with most things women the research is limited. Diagnosis for me only took a year and I really lucked out with my ENT, but there are a TON of things that can cause vertigo. The biggest thing for me was realizing I had specific triggers I needed to keep an eye out for and also tracking my symptoms carefully. Weather is my biggest trigger, so I just kind of have to ride it out, but it is manageable now that I know what is causing it. \n\nGo easy on yourself, vertigo is awful and stress makes it worse. Try the Epley maneuver and see about getting in with an ENT if it persists. If it does end up being migraines, pay attention to your symptoms before, during, and after your migraine and let your doc know if you experience aura as estrogen based hormone therapies can increase your risk for stroke.\n\nEdit: clarified that I did not conduct the clinical research, just read peer reviewed studies available on PubMed.",

  "I'm having vertigo now.  The longest continuous episode ever for me.  I'm up to just over a month.  I know it can be from various things but I decided to rope in my neuro first and ask them for help.  He's ordered a brain MRI, ENG, and prescribed me a steroid pack.  Also told me to try meclizine (I did - it does nothing for me).  I have my ENG tomorrow morning and am really nervous about it.  I read they might put hot or cold water in my ears (which sounds super not fun).  But I do hope we figure out the cause and can stop it.  I'm on HRT.  I have a history of anemia and low ferritin but since I had an iron infusion in August I doubt it's low again (?). I feel like I'm on a boat at all times.  Sometimes it's worse than others - if I exercise or look down or am tired or when I'm in bed.  It's worst is in bed if I move my head or neck suddenly and then it can feel like the room is shaking.  I also have this feeling of pressure like a giant weight from above and at an angle is pushing down on me.\n\nThe results are back from the MRI and show I have a chronic sinus infection.  I don't know if that could be contributing but it makes sense as I realize symptoms that I had assumed were allergies.  I'm not scheduled to see my provider to discuss test results for three weeks - I'm hoping I can get in sooner after I have the ENG in the morning.\n\nI'm 43 and have had episodic vertigo and/or dizziness since I was a teen.  Just never lasted this long before!",

  "I had vertigo for almost 4 months, almost continuously. Saw ENT and they ruled out vestibular issues, blood tests ruled out ferritin, MRI and EKG showed nothing. I did get dx’d with POTS, but that wasn’t actually associated, just a comorbidity. Neurologist dx’d me with dairy (mostly some times random) triggered vestibular migraines, but they were also different than the vertigo. Finally saw an occupational therapist for visual dizziness who gave me some exercises as well as referral to a neuro-optometrist who dx’d me with binocular vision disorder. Symptoms were being treated with marginal success. Ultimately, everything was neurological and I think increased estrogen was what finally shook everything loose. I think COVID may have brought on the POTS and menopause brought on the vertigo. I would go through phases in peri where I’d have big swings that would last a week and in reflection, think that I was possibly having estrogen dips. Nothing worked for me in terms of eply maneuver, sea sick meds, orthogonal chiropractic, acupuncture, massage, diet change, sugar elimination etc. zofran prevented the nausea but it was the most miserable I’ve ever been. I cried so many times in Dr offices when they said they couldn’t point to the problem. Keep seeking a solution, yours is out there.",

Everything was fine and they were definitely helping my sleep. I use My Alloy for my prescriptions, so they send 3 months of meds at a time. The next bottle I got I noticed the pills were a different color and shaped a little different, but didn't think too much of it. My sleep wasn't nearly as good as soon as I started the new pills. They still make me sleepy and it's easy to fall asleep, but I'm waking up a lot more throughout the night and I'm feeling a lot more anxious when I do wake up. I've also noticed my nose has been stuffed up every night since the change and my throat has been sore every morning. The new pills are made by Bionpharma. I'll contact my Alloy provider, but I'm not sure they have any say over which brand I get. I might try taking it vaginally in the meantime to see if the symptoms abate. Anyone else notice anything like this with their progesterone?",

Seems many prefer that brand.",

Aurobindo is what Alloy sends me. So for now I'm filling the Xiromed progesterone prescription locally from my original provider (long story) and hoping Alloy sends a different brand at some point. \n\nAfter a couple months of stability I took an Aurobindo again just in case something else had caused my problem. Nope! Definitely was the Aurobindo.",
  "I had mine compounded and they worked great but I figured I could save a few bucks moving them to CVS as the only thing that’s different is the substrate that the progesterone is put in.

  "Hi everyone;\n\nAfter over a year of trying, I finally got to start HRT about six weeks ago.   I started on the lower dose combipatch.

My mood was worse again and I was tired.   My doctor recommended trying the higher dose of combi\nPatch.    I started it on Saturday.  Since then my migraines have been almost non-stop and not responding to my typical meds.   But I do notice a small improvement in mood and energy, maybe. \n\nToday is my day to change my patch and I’m really really wanting to go down to the lower dose again.   \n\nDoes anyone have experience with this?   I really want to get back to that first few weeks on the low\nDose.   Why would I see benefit and then lose it?  \n\nThank you!!",
  "I would recommended not using a combo - ask for estradiol patch and then separated progesterone. That way you can alter dosing of either separately when needed.

My HRT is a .05 estradiol patch by Sandoz 2x a week and 100mg progesterone every night.\n\nPeriods, pregnancy, birth control all cause intractable headaches for me, so it’s significant that HRT has not.

  "I had been on compounded estrogen/testosterone cream for around 7 years with no issues. Dosage 6MG-1MG/0.5ML cream that I put on twice a day. Am not on progesterone because I have no uterus. Around the last year of that dosage, I started to get severely depressed/suicidal/anxiety. Never any issues before. No medication changes, no life changes that would cause these feelings. Doctor did a blood test and said hormones were in normal range but slightly on the lower side so maybe I should try a different form of estrogen. He switched me to Mylan estrogen patches and I did my normal dose of testosterone in a compounded cream as well. I did the .025, .035, .050, .075, and lastly .1. I stayed on the patches for about 6 weeks. Mental health felt significantly better but my nipples were so sore that I could barely manage the pain, even with wearing a bra 24/7 and using a heating pad. The other symptom I got with the patches were my body would feel like I had an electric current running through it, but I didn’t feel hyper or anything or have excess energy or what I would describe as an estrogen high, I could just feel every feeling in my body and my pulse in my fingertips and toes if that makes sense. My right arm continuously felt heavy and my hand would lock up. Since stopping the patches, both symptoms cleared up in about a week. But back on the cream again I am back to those debilitating mental symptoms. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I don’t know what else to try or do. I need my life back. ",

I was coasting along no issues at 51, then in October I got hit with chronic insomnia that triggered anxiety/panic attacks &amp; deep depression with suicidal thoughts 😞 I’d been on a .5 estradiol patch for a bit over a year when it all started; no progesterone because I don’t have a uterus.

I have no health insurance so I'm about to sign up with Winona and they recommended oral DHEA and a progesterone/estrogen cream. I asked if the cream was applied vaginally or elsewhere and the answer sounded like they'd be happy to sell me a *separate* vaginal cream. The doctor didn't say where you apply the regular version?! I can't afford both and I'm not sure which would be best. I'll keep asking questions of the Winona doctor but I'm curious to hear from Winona users here what their experience has been with these two cream products. Thanks",
  "Estrogen **cream** is for vaginal atrophy (GSM), a *localized* treatment.  \n\nIf the estrogen cream is for *systemic* use, then these are compounded products, which are not recommended as effective or even safe hormone therapy.  Progesterone **cream** does not absorb well transdermally, so if you are using systemic estrogen (and have a uterus) this cream does not provide any uterine protection, therefore increasing risks for uterine cancer.",

She listened, made jokes, prescribed exactly what I wanted, gave me 90 day supply of everything, and told me to message them if I need a dose change. Only sad part was my state won't allow testosterone (a controlled medication) to be filled by a tele health provider.

They are equally easy but without as much of a platform/patient portal kind of thing.\n\nIf not, I hope you can find an easy provider for T too.

I thought one of you may be able to offer up some information, based on your own experience—before I make an appointment with my doctor.\n\nI’m 44 and struggling HARD with night sweats.  Truly, I sleep with towels and need to change my sheets daily.  I sweat from parts of my body that I didn’t know had sweat glands!  Thing is—I’m not hot.  If anything, I’m cold and wet.  I don’t have hot flashes during the day, and this is the only symptom I’m aware of at the moment.\n\nI’m not opposed to HRT, but I’m wondering if any of my current treatments make me incompatible?\n\n-Hormonal IUD\n\n-GLP-1 for weight loss\n\n-Antidepressants\n\n-Stimulant (ADHD)\n\nThank you in advance!\n",

Even in the dead of winter, I had to sleep with a fan blowing on me. I changed all my bedding too tencel and stopped wearing pajamas but I would still wake up drenched in sweat. I don’t feel like I really ever had hot flashes just night sweats. It’s so hard to get a good nights sleep when you feel hot, wet and sticky.",
  "Night sweats are a common side effect of a number of antidepressants, could that be the cause?",
  "I started HRT and a GLP1 around the same time. Not intentionally,  but because I needed both. I needed to lose weight and I also suffered from night sweats. After starting on an estradiol patch, my night sweats stopped within a week. The 85lbs I lost took a bit longer.😉",
  "I'm on multiple of those meds you listed and I had no issue with contraindications. I'm not on a hormonal IUD, but my progestin half of my HRT is the minipill (Norethindrone). An IUD is actually one of the options they give if you're being prescribed estrogen and you have a uterus. Options are basically a progestin (like minipill), micronized progesterone or an IUD.",
  "Night sweats are a form of “hot flash” and a sign of low estrogen. I would play the hot flashes up A LOT, like make sure you communicate how they are impacting your life. Estrogen is FDA approved to treat hot flashes and nothing else, even though we here in this group all know there are many other symptoms of low estrogen. The safest and most common form of estrogen replacement currently is transdermal, via a gel or patch.\n\nThen, if you have a uterus still, your doctor also needs to prescribe a form of progesterone, but since you have an IUD, this might not be necessary depending on what kind it is. \n\nIf you have any symptoms of vaginal atrophy, then also ask for vaginal estrogen.",
  "I don’t mean to scare you, but night sweats can also be a symptom of worse things, like certain kinds of cancer. It goes without saying, but before adding HRT to the mix always good to get some basic bloodwork to ensure everything else is fine before trying something new. Either way, hope you get some relief because that’s no fun!",

I've not taken it but did take gabapentin for a time for nerve pain, pre-peri, and found it made me just sort of slooooow. I'm wondering if you increase your estrogen, and possibly add progesterone, if that wouldn't better address the pain and anxiety so you wouldn't need the pregabalin. I had chronic pain that I was sure was arthritis, and that disappeared almost overnight with the estradiol patch.",

  "Hello, I am responding to your message. I’ve been going through the same thing. I’ve tried the BHRT‘s and have had nothing but bad luck with them had terrible side effects. I’m feeling nauseous. Very fatigued lost my appetite. Night sweats got worse so now today was my first day of trying, Anna‘s wild yam cream And I don’t know if I can use it, but I also bought myself some silky peach cream. I only use the Anna one time which was today and I had a decent day today so I’m hoping that this works so maybe try wild yam cream and silky peach I’ve heard Great things about both of them. I will update you because I’m going to bed now and see if I have my night sweats and how I feel in the morning when I wake up cause my days are horrible and they’ve been horrible for six months now, so I feel where you’re coming from and I understand so many women have had great luck with BHRT for myself.

  "A bit of background- I’m about to turn 52. I’ve always been pretty healthy with little effort. I have always been conscious about what I eat and been thin. The covid lock down really threw me for a loop. I gained about 20 lbs and was very very anxious. Over the past two years I have worked to change that. I went on antidepressants, I lost 20 lbs and started on low dose birth control to help with perimenopause symptoms. I “thought” I was taking pretty good care of myself. I barely even drink alcohol anymore when I used to drink weekly. So a couple of weeks ago I ended up in the ER with high blood pressure. While I was there they did a ct scan and found I have atherosclerosis of the carotid artery in my brain. Typically caused by high cholesterol. Historically my cholesterol has never been high so they ordered blood tests. My cholesterol is now 207 so it’s high but not horribly so. They put me on blood pressure meds and I took myself off birth control pills. I try to exercise daily and I also count calories every day. I have a bmi of 24 when it used to be 21-22 when I was younger. So I’m actively trying to lose weight to get my bmi lower thinking that could be my problem. I know my lifestyle isn’t perfect but I also don’t think it’s that terrible either not now I feel like it’s my fault that I’m having health issues. Is this life from here on out? Will it just be a struggle to stay healthy? Can any of this be related to menopause. I still get a period but I have a ton of peri menopause symptoms. I’m just having a hard time accepting the “new” me when I thought I was doing so well and it’s not be good enough.  ",
  "Try not to blame yourself. Most of our health issues are genetic/bad luck (and of course, hormonal).\n\nI’ve always been healthy, exercised (even taught exercise classes for many years), eaten healthy, I don’t drink at all, I’ve never smoked, and yet, shit really hit the fan for me when I started perimenopause. I didn’t even realize it was perimenopause. I wish I could rewind the clock and NOT blame myself for my health issues and not internalize it because it caused a lot of unnecessary grief, anxiety and sadness. I think our culture does this to women and the medical community participates, exacerbating the problem. “You’re a woman with a health issue? It must be your fault!” We are told it’s anxiety, it’s in our heads, we need to lose weight or we did something wrong. It’s absolute bullshit. Menopause sucks for most women. \n\nDo your best to avoid blaming yourself for any of it. Focus on self soothing, self advocating, controlling only what you can control, and finding good supports (therapist, healthy friends, etc.). I’m sorry you are struggling, but it’s not your fault.",
  "The pause is known to affect cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and the distribution and accumulation of fat.   \n  \nBeing on HRT at adequate doses mitigates some of it but not all of it.",
  "A huge part of the problem is women thinking that it’s “normal” or “genetic” because their own mothers had high cholesterol and high BP in their 40’s and 50’s. It’s not normal or genetics. It’s decreasing hormone levels wreaking havoc on your body. If you had scurvy because of low vitamin C levels, you’d take a Vitamin C supplement and eat some citrus. It’s the same thing. Supplemental hormone therapy is necessary. Bone loss, depression, anxiety, heart disease…these are not genetic inclinations when they hit you like a brick wall in your late 30’s, 40’s and 50’s. You need to get your hormones balanced again. If you break a hip at 62, they don’t leave it broken and tell you it’s going to hurt for the rest of your life and there’s nothing they can do about it. They surgically repair it, they put you on prescription calcium supplementation and they rehab you as close as possible to your former glory. The rest of your body needs the same. Enough with the “talk with a therapist”, “reach out to friends going through it”, “try not to blame yourself”! It’s a deficiency. Supplement and get your life back!",

  "It’s all related to Menopause. \nMy BP and cholesterol shot up sky high out of nowhere last year and they wanted to throw me on statins and BP meds. I’ve lifted heavy weights and worked out most of my adult life and I eat an all organic and whole food diet. In addition to the rise in BP/cholesterol, I also began having massive mood swings, doomsday anxiety and depression out of nowhere. After joining menopause groups and learning that I needed BHRT, I unsuccessfully addressed it with my GP and Gyno and got nowhere. Birth control pills will make it worse. You need total replacement of E, P and T and vaginal estrogen cream. I eventually went with an online provider who doesn’t take insurance (Defy because they offer injections and T) and I wish that I hadn’t waited so long because I am feeling more and more like myself every week now and it’s only been 3 months. I take oral compounded P and inject compounded T and E twice a week. \nI was nearly suicidal from all of it and if you knew me, you’d understand that it was like someone had flipped a switch. \nNow…No more being awake after 2am. \nNo more depression and anxiety. \nNo more heart palpitations. \nMy energy is up. \nMy vaginal dryness and itching is completely gone. \nMy SEVERE bilateral hip, knee and elbow pain is completely GONE after years of excruciating pain and multiple rounds of PT and PRP. \nNo more hot flashes and night sweats. \nMy brain fog and word finding difficulties have significantly improved and I actually enjoy having conversations again and I am truly just enjoying life again. \n\nI’ve since learned that cholesterol is directly related to estrogen levels. I now take a Red Rice Yeast extract from a local Chinese medicine Dr to lower my cholesterol and it has indirectly helped my BP as well. (I’m not advocating that for others. I have an autoimmune disease and prescription statins have historically made it worse so I chose a more natural route. They both can cause dizziness, stomach upset and complications with your liver and kidneys so whatever you decide to take, make sure that you are getting labs drawn a month after starting and then at least every 3 months going forward.)\n\nSome internet wisdom for you below regarding menopause and cholesterol:\n\nDuring and after menopause, women often experience changes in cholesterol levels, with a tendency for “bad” LDL cholesterol to increase and “good” HDL cholesterol to decrease, potentially raising the risk of heart disease. \n\nHormonal Changes:\nMenopause is marked by a significant drop in estrogen levels, which plays a role in regulating cholesterol levels\n\nIncreased LDL (bad) cholesterol: Estrogen helps the liver regulate cholesterol, and its decline can lead to a buildup of LDL cholesterol in the arteries. \nDecreased HDL (good) cholesterol: Estrogen also helps remove cholesterol from the body, and its decrease can lead to lower levels of HDL cholesterol.",
  "These are all classic signs of perimenopause and a result of declining estrogen levels. We have estrogen receptors in every part of our body, so when estrogen declines, there is a cascade of physical and mental issues. You begin to gain weight and add visceral fat around the abdomen, your cholesterol and BP go up despite no change to diet and exercise. You lose sleep and suffer from depression and rage with a helping of anxiety thrown in. Your bones become more brittle, your joints ache, and your vagina and clitoris atrophy. You can become more prone to UTIs. You increase your risks of cardiovascular disease and stroke. \n\nGrim, I know. But now for the good news. HRT can help with many of these issues.  And no it's not you, it's your body going through menopause. I hope you can find a knowledgeable menopause specialist to help you navigate through these waters. A good place to start is at menopause.org or try one of the online providers like myalloy.com or Midi. And, please be kind to yourself. You deserve treatment.",

  "I just turned 52 also, am that \"annoyingly healthy\" friend. Always been some sort of athlete, yoga practice, in the gym at 5am x 5 days a week (cardio, heavy weights), don't drink, never smoked.

  "When you first start using Vagifem or any vaginal estrogen, your vaginal tissue is generally dry and more porous than healthy tissue, and you can have micro-tears or chafing and larger tearing if you've had penetrative sex. \n\nWhen you're at that stage of vaginal atrophy, vaginal estrogen can be absorbed into the blood stream through those micro-tears and porous, damaged tissue. Once your tissue starts to heal and once your healthy bacterial community colonizes the healthy tissue and you start to produce a bit of lubrication, you will once again have a healthy barrier and the vaginal estrogen will remain in the local tissues. \n\nSo what this looks like is: to treat atrophied vaginal tissue you start on a regimen of daily estrogen use for two weeks (this is the stage where you are actively healing this tissue) and you may have some systemic absorption as the damaged tissue does not soak in the estrogen and micr-tears allow the estrogen direct travel into your blood vessels. After the initial repair stage comes the maintenance stage in which newly repaired tissue just needs to be maintained, and at this stage you generally transition to either every other day or twice-weekly vaginal estrogen use. Healed tissue is not as porous, and you will not get systemic absorption but most or all estrogen will stay localized to vaginal tissue. \n\nAlso, anatomy: the closer to the vaginal opening you put the estrogen, the fewer blood vessels you have close to the surface, the less estrogen will be absorbed systemically. The closer to your cervix/deeper in the vaginal canal you put the estrogen, the more blood vessels you have, the more estrogen will be absorbed systemically. Since Vagifem is a pill with a long applicator meant to insert deep in the canal, it will dissolve while in contact with vaginal tissue with a denser supply of blood vessels. In contrast, vaginal estrogen cream can be placed anywhere in the vagina, and for women who find they are getting systemic reactions while in the early healing stages, often doctors will prescribe cream instead and tell you to insert it only in the lower third of the vaginal canal, nearest to the opening. This will help heal tissue without as much contact with the deeper tissue and therefore less systemic uptake. \n\nOnce the tissue is healed and you're ready for maintenance of the healed tissue, Vagifem is generally well tolerated again as it has a very low concentration and that newly healthy tissue will again create a barrier to absorption into your blood stream.",

It did for me and i had to stop taking it after a few days as it was giving me severe migraines and i felt pretty rotten all round.

  "How many of you are only on Progesterone?  I’m 51 and my Dr put me on 100mg of Progesterone over a year ago. Is this normal?  I have an appointment with her this week to discuss estrogen. \n\nI hate to stop it because it has helped my super heavy periods to almost non existent BUT…. I’ve started having all these weird symptoms the last 5 months. I first want to say, 5 months ago I was COMPLETELY OPPOSITE of any of these. I am a business owner and have always been a leader and honestly more of a selfish person. \n\nHere’s just a few of the things taking place….Fear of being away from my husband or alone, I CANNOT make decisions to save my life, scary brain fog, major anxiety, insomnia, overly sensitive, giving into my kids for fear they will be upset with me, not wanting to watch sad shows(I love sad shows), sad, I could go on and on. WHAT IS THIS??  It’s all too bazaar to just be anxiety or depression but possibly?  I almost think I’m needing estrogen or to stop the progesterone but the progesterone was fine for at least 6-7 months??",
  "You might have been fine on only progesterone 6-7 months ago but at your age estrogen is either all over the place or sinking, so what worked even some months ago won’t necessarily still be enough. Don’t let your doc tell you you need an antidepressant or anti anxiety . Definitely push to try adding estrogen if you can.",
  "I was on 100mg of progesterone for a year and started having the same symptoms you described. Went in to my doctor and she upped my dose to 200mg and it’s helped tremendously. I’ll be starting estrogen patch today.",
  "I sorta was until a few days ago. I have a Mirena IUD which releases progesterone so haven't had periods in eons. It definitely hid a lot of my perimenopause symptoms and the ones I was having, I thought I could live with or didn't realize they were caused by peri because I also have a lot of work stress right now. Basically everything you've listed. I just started estrogen and I don't care what they say about it needing a few weeks to kick in, I can feel a difference already in my mood, sleep, at the gym, and even this stupid recurring case of BV I've had to deal with off and on for a couple years.",

  "I was on Mirena IUD (with synthetic progestin) for excessive bleeding (when progesterone pill alone didn’t help.) I had no other peri issues. A year later a lot of common peri issues started, so my gynecologist started me the estrogen patch.

The downside is it carries a small risk of blood clots that patches don't. I'm ok with that risk though because I need to function in my day to day life.",
  "I’m taking Yaz birth control. I’ve never had a break from BC and I started Yaz about 8 months ago after a virtual appointment with a menopause specialist. She recommended that for me because I have migraines that are hormone related and that HRT could result in more/worse migraines. I feel better now than I did before switching pills.

I loved it at first, for a month or two, then I developed horrible side effects. I was afraid to take HRT because of that but it’s been a completely different experience for me. I finally feel like myself again. My mood has evened out, anxiety is controlled and I don’t get hot flashes anymore. I was full of anxiety on the pill. I would never take birth control again.",
  "I wasn’t using it as an HRT replacement, but the best I felt during peri menopause was the two years I was on birth control. Been doing HRT for two years and still don’t feel right.",
  "There are differences in BC and HRT. The doses of HRT are lower than most BC and if you are on estradiol patches and progesterone, they are different kinds of estrogen and progestin than BC. There is a slight increased risk of clotting on BC and the type of progestin used in BC is not always as effective in helping with sleep. What you use should be based on your symptoms, not labs tests, as there is no lab test to determine you're in perimenopause. Why did your MD say BC would be better for you?",
  "I’m on BCP because I also have PCOS. Any time I’ve tried to go off of it for an alternative I’ve had issues related to that including a rupture. I needed the higher dose. People love to hate on BCP but honestly I’ve been so fortunate my body tolerates it well. I’m 43, husband has a vasectomy. Doc wants to wait until I’m at least 50 and then talk hysterectomy. Ovarian cancer took my grandmother before I was born and my mom had a preventative hysterectomy when I was in hs after being diagnosed with stage 1 ovarian cancer. Thankfully that took care of it and I still have her. The only thing I’ll do differently is she went off HRT at 65 and I will die with whatever patch or pill I’m still using in my system. She should have stayed on it for the osteoporosis prevention but 65 was almost 15 years ago for her and we know how much the advice has changed in the last few years.",

  "Sorry this is a lot to unpack here but I need to vent. Since January I've been in a downward spiral with my mental state, I've been struggling the worst I ever have in years financially and it's taken all huge toll on my household , Now I'm barely getting any sleep. Then when I do get sleepy it's at the most inconvenient times, no matter where I am during the day too which is so embarrassing. When I try an nap I  can only nap for maybe 2hrs at the most. I try an lay down around 10 or 11pm maybe sleep till 2 or 3 and I'm just up till I hear the birds . Yeah, this messed up my entire day. I'm hot af just doing the smallest things and feel bitchy most days but also take phentermine but not daily and that only works when it wants too because I'm still hungry as hell!!! I'm calm, then sad, then angry and I'm not even going to go into how bad my anxiety has been lately it's probably the worst it's ever been. I've been on Prozac since last year and it didn't even make me feel this crazy when I first started. Plus I'm trying to not give up on my weight loss journey that I start over a year ago. I'm just stalled at 183-185 started at 235. I feel like I have to do the most to lose now and I'm not motivated anymore to continue but I can't bring myself to give up. Periods are heavy still, but now only last about 5 days or less sometimes. I'll be 39 April 25th and this is all too much. I'm so confused lately, extremely tired, just feel dead inside and kinda feel like I'm losing my damn mind. Is this the start of menopause or is this something else I need to be more concerned about?

I found myself adding more and more liquor to try and feel normal, social, and sexy.

I am not exaggerating when I say that this tiny pill fixed 90% of my problems overnight.  No more hot flashes, no racing thoughts, beautiful sleep through the night.  I have been on it for.a year and I am so thankful.\n\nAlso, I am on Zepbound.  I started with compounded tirzepatide, but that will no longer be available as of tomorrow.  I had gained a ton of weight, eating emotionally and my hunger was strong.  Again, this is a life saving drug.  It calmed my head noise and turned off my cravings.  I have lost over 40 lbs since October.\n\nAdditionally, I was recently diagnosed adhd, and am on adderall.\n\nI finally feel like I have control of my life again.

And congrats on noticing it pretty quickly.\nIt took me 4 years of hell and misdiagnosing … I didn’t actually know the symptoms of peri menopause until recently… but really my GP should have recognised it from my symptoms, as it’s quite obvious tbh.\nI’ve been on HRT for a week, and some symptoms have decreased already. The first night of taking it, I had a freaking wonderful sleep.\n\nBefore, I was waking up every hour, sometimes for hours at a time.\nNow, I’m waking up once or twice, for about 5-15 minutes, then falling back to sleep.\n\nI hope you find some relief!",
  "If you figured it out in only a few months, good for you! It took me several years of slowly declining mental health, with repeated poor life decisions due to that, and slowly mounting physical symptoms for me to make the link. I thought I was going insane, I was having panic attacks, I was having fits of rage, I was ready to kill myself. Psych meds did nothing (except Xanax) and came with a butt load of ongoing side effects. HRT has reduced but not eliminated the issues. It sucks. \n\n\nI cannot diagnose but perimenopause (usually what people colloquially call \"going through menopause\"), but what you describe is consistent with that. Mental healthy declines for up to 50% of women, resulting in new diagnoses, worsening symptoms, increased need for medication when coping skills were previously sufficient, and existing medications no longer working as they did before. It's swell (sarcasm). \n\n\nIt can be worth talking with a doctor to rule things out. If you have a therapist, keep close. You mentioned bipolar and menopause can definitely trigger issues with that. ",

  "You're not actually in Menopause until you have been without a period for 12 months. Perimenopause can last a decade and SUCKS!! But .. please... Everyone be careful. I was put on Progesterone to balance myself out. 2 years later... At age 44... Hormone induced breast cancer. I have a double masectomy last year. Now .. because of the type of cancer it was... I had to be put into medically induced menopause. It sucked. My body was fucked. All the same symptoms you're describing plus more. I now take an infusion every month and hormone blockers every day to keep me in menopause and block my body from producing any estrogen. I'm finally feeling good again. So it does seem that once you get through the change... Things get better. But yeah... That change is a real bitch. I guess now I'm thankful that it only lasted a few months. But if I could go back a few years and let my body do what it wanted to do (perimenopause... Loss of progesterone, etc..) instead of taking hormones so I could be \"more comfortable\" essentially....  I absolutely would. My body was doing what it was supposed to do. I fucked it up by replacing hormones that weren't (naturally) supposed to be replaced and in turn... I gave myself cancer. So please.... Look at your family history and discuss the pros and cons of HRT with your doctor and really weigh the benefits. For sleep.... Ask your doctor for some sleeping pills.  I ce you get proper rest... Other things should start to feel better. \nGood luck.",
  "You very well could have a thyroid issue. I would ask my doctor to do a FULL thyroid panel (test anti-thyroid antibodies also!!). Many thyroid issues mimic mental health problems (even bipolar, anxiety, etc) and peri/menopause. Also have D, zinc, B12, selenium, iron, etc. tested. These are all super easy to test with a simple blood test so may as well rule these out.

  "Hey friend. First of all, I am so sorry things have been extra hard lately. I have been there more times than I can count, and my heart goes out to you. \n\nThe first thing you need to do is call your doctor and tell them you think you're starting menopause and you need to see your doctor soon due to the physical, mental, and emotional effects. They will help. \n\nNext thing. Have you had enough to eat or drink today? When I started going through menopause, I was so bad about eating. A lot of times, I didn't want to, so I decided that on days I didn't want to eat, I would promise myself I could have whatever sounded good (with reason). One afternoon, I drove two hours to have lunch with my best friend and her dad. I emailed my professor and thesis supervisor that I wouldn't be in class. \n\nSometimes, when everything is going to hell, you have to cut yourself off from chaos before you become a part of it. \n\nDoorDash your fav meal. Take a bath or shower with your favorite products. Pour a glass of wine. Sit down with some Lofi and play video games or read. Try to check out for a bit. It will help. You might even be able to sleep. \n\nIf you need suggestions, Effexor is an antidepressant that has also been shown to help with menopause symptoms. I'm on it, and it's been significantly better. Maybe you can talk to your doctor about trying it out to see if it's right for you. 🧡",
  "I'm not an expert, but what you're going through may be an \"all-of-the-above\" situation. The poor-quality sleep that comes with menopause throws everything into disarray and makes those emotional 'highs and lows' even more pronounced. A diet may be impacting your moods as well. A few years ago, I tried keto and got super-irritable. Sadly it gets much more challenging to lose weight when menopause starts. And when you're having heavy periods, that just adds to the energy depletion. Your body never has a chance to recharge to 100% before your battery starts draining again. I don't have any solutions, but as someone who struggles with depression, please know that March/April are apparently the worst months. Most people think December is the \"lowest\" month, but apparently it's March/April - the end of a long winter is when many people think that they just can't make it to the summertime. I am going through a rough time right now and I am going to try a walk each night before bed to see if it helps to \"clear my head\" and improve my sleep. Hang in there; everything you're feeling is (sadly) par for the course with perimenopause and menopause.",

I also have MS so when the menopause came it was insane. \nI have gone on bioidentical hormones from my doctor (but I started with the ones on Amazon first!) they SAVED my life. Progesterone got me from 4 day insomnia straight to sleeping 4-5 hours straight",
  "How many 100mcg oestrogen patches produce the same level of oestrogen in the blood as a healthy pre-peri 35 year old woman?\n\nI appreciate that hormones have a range.",
  "On average, a 100 mcg/day patch leads to estrogen levels of 100 pg/mL. The normal range for estrogen levels for someone who is not pregnant and not in perimenopause is 30 to 400 pg/mL. That varies across the menstrual cycle, so that estrogen briefly spikes above that right before ovulation, and is at the low end around the time that your period starts. \n\n\nSo one patch puts the average person within the normal range, what you would expect in the early follicular phase, when you are starting a new cycle. \n\n\nHowever, some people can't absorb transdermal estrogen well, even high doses, so if you are on a high dose and still having peri symptoms, that may be the issue. ",
  "This is why I’m going to make sure my daughter gets her hormones thoroughly checked starting at age 18 or so. I wish I knew my numbers. I have a feeling that I was too low estrogen starting in my late 20s though due to a severe eating disorder and undiagnosed celiac disease. \n\nMy earliest hormone test that I can find is from when I was 32 and my estrogen was 130. My progesterone was almost 0 so I’m assuming that it was early in my cycle. So I probably was estrogen deficient then but who knows. \n\nMy doctor said that it can vary for young women that are healthy up to 500 obviously with dips in the cycle. Often not below 150. Progesterone usually doesn’t show up much until luteal phase. Testosterone is usually\nAround 50-70 in our twenties and late teens.",
  "From everything I’ve read I have concluded that roughly 200pgml would be an average of the entire menstrual cycle and this is why I wear 2 x 0.1mg patches as theoretically this delivers 200pgml in the blood if absorbed correctly. \n\nI’ve checked absorption enough times to see that across the three days I wear them, I’m getting slightly above or below this so happy with that. \n\nIt’s also enough to essentially lower my FSH right down, to the point where my own cycle is less involved, makes for more stable experience in my view. Also proof that my pituitary is happy with what it’s getting and isn’t needing to ask the ovaries for more.",

I am thinking about questions I need to ask.\n\nI started HRT because my periods had become extremely heavy &amp; kept getting closer together. Also started night sweats, hot flashes, and brain fog was worsening. \n\nHRT helped those physical symptoms. Meanwhile, my emotional symptoms were uncontrollable and I started bleeding- a lot. Not menstrual blood, either. So I have an ultrasound and am diagnosed with a polyp. I have surgery to remove the polyp (hysterscopy w d&amp;c). Turns out it was a fibroid, not a polyp.\n\nMy bleeding doesn't stop. I have periods of relief but lately it gets worse. My last bleed was 14 days and 7 of those were extremely heavy.\n\nHave another ultrasound 2 weeks ago. Another fibroid. Surgery recommended. This time, a Hysterectomy, robotically and keeping the ovarios.\n\nI have an appointment next week to discuss surgery.\n\nI have a million questions. Most of them are about why this is happening all of a sudden after no history of fibroids or irregular bleeding. \n\nAlso, my doctor is very communicative, supportive, and helpful. Super excited about HRT options and seems to want to help...BUT, has already performed surgery once based on an inaccurate diagnosis (which is apparently an easy mistake to make- reading a fibroid as a polyp on the ultrasound). When he called me with my ultrasound results, he did not have my history available and did not take into account my 1st surgery. He originally called to recommend the same surgery, but when I reminded him of my history he revised his suggestion and scheduled an appointment to discuss the surgery.\n\nThanks for bearing with me, my ultimate question is what questions would you have and what stands out to you here as important to ask the doctor about my situation.\n\nTbh, right now I am just looking forward to the possibility of a Hysterectomy to end all of this mysery- hopefully this is a good thing 🤷‍♀️",
  "Be prepared that your ovarian function will diminish further with the loss of the uterus. No one warned me about that and my menopause symptoms got way worse.",
  "Get your iron checked, especially ferritin. I was extremely anemic after years of heavy periods, and (ironically) my period got a lot better once I started iron supplementation.",
  "I had a hysterectomy at age 46 due to fibroids and horrific periods. I kept my ovaries and tubes. I felt absolutely fantastic afterwards and I wish I had the surgery earlier. I put it off for four years because I was terrified of the recovery period and possibly missing months of work. I had the robot surgery, and I was walking around about two hours after my surgery. I read a lot of horror stories before my surgery, but I got lucky. No regrets at all.  I believe menopause happened for me at age 52. That’s another post.",
  "Many women have fibroids that never grow larger than a bean or cause any problems. For others, the estrogen spikes in peri can make them grow larger and, depending on their location in the uterus, they cause all sorts of symptoms. Full menopause should stop them growing but depending on how big they had were, might not stop any symptoms due to bulk (eg them pushing on ureters/urethras).\n\nAsk about other options. You’ve tried myomectomy (removal) and found that they grow back. Depending on their size and location, you could try UFE (embolisation) or MrgFUS (MRI targeted ultrasound).\n\nA hysterectomy might be the answer. The bigger the fibroids, the more invasive the surgery. If your ovaries aren’t causing problems, keep them but have the fallopian tubes removed - it reduces the risk of ovarian cancer. Again, if you’ve no history of abnormal cells, you can ask to keep your cervix and have a subtotal hysterectomy. The hystersisters website is a bit old fashioned but has lots of information on conditions that might require hystos and what questions to ask. Best of luck",
  "Have you tried an IUD yet? I’m 46 with similar issues and after my last polyp removal, I got an IUD under anesthesia. Hoping that helps me!",
  "BEST DECISION I EVER MADE. Seriously. I want to send thank you cards to my surgeon. Just make sure that the doctor doing your surgery is actually good at surgery and does them regularly. Look into the different ways it can be done in a minimally invasive way and see if they’re capable of that.\n\nI lost an ovary because I have endo. It was already blown up though. My hormones are fine. They took a hit for a couple months after - like month 2-3 post surgery. Everything has gone back to how it was before and I had a massive 6 hour dumpster fire of a surgery.\n\nOh also ask if they attach the top of the vagina to everything. I think the sacral ligaments. This will prevent prolapse in the future. If you’ve had children vaginally, a hysterectomy actually reduces your risk of uterine prolapse.",
  "Did they do a uterine biopsy by chance?",
  "Maybe try birth control pills taken continuously, a hormonal IUD, or non-hormonal tranexamic acid before resorting to hysterectomy, one of the top overused surgeries. Also, you could probably use iron supplements which may reduce bleeding. Even Rx strength (800 mg) NSAID's can reduce bleeding.\n\nThere are a number of negatives of hysterectomy especially in the long term, even if you keep your ovaries. You may find [this resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/HysterectomyCons/wiki/index/) helpful.\n\nGood luck with whatever treatment(s) you choose.",
  "I've been in misery for about 2 months with that UTI feeling of a burning urethra. I was already on estrogen cream, but it just didn't seem to work anymore. My doctor put me on all kinds of estrogen-pumping meds and I bought a lot of over-the-counter moisturizers. They helped some. Then I read on this forum how the urethra and clitoris can atrophy. I started putting the estrogen cream on my urethra 2-3x a day for the last two days. And suddenly, the pain is gone!! Could it be that simple? I certainly hope so. My last hope was the Mona Lisa Touch at the cost of about $2700. At that cost, no thanks. I'm a little embarrassed that I had to use a mirror and Google where the urethra actually is on the female body. It's so damned tiny!\n\nEdit: And it's been 5 days painfree.

So glad to see here that no one else knows how to clean this dumb, scratchy thing either! THank god for this site, women telling women what works.",
  "My NP told me to split the two weekly applications bw. inside and outside - insert vaginally once a week, and then smear around the outside of the vaginal opening and urethra for the second application.

That’s why I’m asking questions and doing research.  \n\nI know there is ongoing debate about the safety of HRT/BHRT and whether it does or does not feed cancer, particularly in reproductive organs and breasts.  I’m genuinely a bit confused about the logic.  Let’s say someone went into early menopause or perimenopause and HRT restored them to the hormone levels of equal to another woman the same age but who hadn’t entered peri/menopause.  Is the logic that both women with higher estrogen would be at more risk than someone with lower estrogen?  That having lower estrogen lowers your risk, so why raise it once it’s lowered?  Or is the logic that something about added hormones (as opposed to naturally occurring) uniquely raises cancer risk?  \n\nI think if adding hormones made my risk equal to what it would be if my hormones were “normal” I’d go for it.  But I’d be nervous if I were prematurely and artificially increasing my risk. \n\n",

  "I didn't read through all the responses to that post, and there were a lot, so I'm not sure if you're referring to the OP of that post or a particular commenter.  In any event, I don't think the original post was implying any patriarchal or religious position - I think she was asking it from a biological standpoint, and asking why what might be a normal biological condition is being pathologized.  I think that's a valid question and worth discussing.\n\nIt is also valid to want to keep your libido strong for ANY reason.  Your own reason, for your marriage, for your boyfriend or girlfriend, or for your own pleasure.  We women are on a much more dramatic hormonal roller coaster throughout our lives than our male counterparts ever are, and of course this can affect our desire for sex.  Heck, young women now seem to know a lot more about their bodies (THANK GOODNESS).  My 19yo daughter knows when she's in her ovulatory phase vs. her luteal phase, and how this affects her mood, skin, and interest in her boyfriend.  It's good that she knows this so young.  I sure as heck didn't know that at age 19 back in the 80's. \n\nTo feel sexual is to feel powerful, IMO.  Some women are willing to give this up and I was also at one time.

Until someone here says to tell their doc it's affecting their libido and relationship. Only then do they get concern, interest, and a solution from their doc. Is it \"natural\" to have a waining sex drive due to hormonal changes? Yes, 100%. Is it a wanted symptom? Maybe for some but not for all. Is it fair that the ONLY symptom our patriarchal society has deemed problematic enough to want to solve, also just so happens to be the one that would impact men? Abso-fucking-lutely not. I think that's the pondering question. Why are they so obsessed with fixing this one thing? It's because it's the only thing they could possibly understand being a problem, both if they themselves lost their sex drive, or how they would feel if their wife/partner did. Bc let's be real, our society was built for and focuses around straight, white men and this would be an unacceptable problem to THEM. But not to all women. Does a waining libido deserve a solution if it's problematic for the person experiencing it? Definitely. But so do allllllllll of the other symptoms we experience.",

  "I'm 45 and have always had regular 26-28 day cycles. All of the sudden my period just didn't arrive (not pregnant) Every week I keep thinking it will show up soon but it's going on 2 and a half months late. How long does the first missed period last? ",
  "Everyone is different.  I’ve had missed periods on and off for 10 years. I’m now mid-50’s, periods stopped for 9 months.  Guess what I got in February?",
  "Mine have always been random and got even more random. My cycle generally lengthened, but by how much was .... ::shrug:: And no warning when it was arriving. Surprise!",
  "It just depends. That could be it. Or you could have more later. I had a 14 month gap and then three months of bonus periods (very light) and that was it.",
  "Not to scare you, but I started by missing a period and getting nothing for 3 months. Then I started bleeding and proceeded to bleed for 2 years straight, without any breaks, until I finally got a hysterectomy.\n\nI'm NOT saying that's what will happen to you. We're all different, and our bodies are doing crazy things. I'm just giving an example of what happened to me and why it's completely unpredictable.",
  "could be many years, or not.",
  "I used to be very independent and strong willed. But with menopause kicking in, my moods are highly unpredictable. And if I accidentally have a bad overnight sleep my next day or two gets miserable. Last week I had one of those episodes of bad sleep days and I was getting agitated if my kids as much as sneeze. I told my older one 7F on how my health is not good. And she was being the big person and handled me really well. Now this week, I’m at a work trip and feeling so miserable for leaving kids at home. My husband said the kids are doing totally fine. But it is me. I’m totally emotionally distraught. At the workplace today there were at least three occasions where I almost broke out into tears and started crying. Has anyone faced this level of emotional distress? How can I deal with it? ",
  "Yes I am almost 41 and I have had the exact same experience. This was my life for almost 2 years. I thought there was something majorly wrong with me and wondered if I was having a breakdown. As the last couple years progressed and symptoms kept stacking on top of each other, I was finally able to put two and two together. It was like fumbling through the dark. It came on so gradually that it meant I figured it out gradually too. My friends and doctor didn’t really take my complaints seriously. So I finally looked into the telehealth/ compounding services that are out there. I recently started using an estriol + estradiol + progesterone cream and taking a DHEA capsule and I can already feel a difference (through Winona). I have had REM sleep for three nights in a row now, not waking up in the middle of the night. That’s a game changer right there. Hot flashes seem to have lessened but we’ll see. Brain fog seems slightly better. I have desire and motivation for chores and self care. I got some things done on my to-do list over the weekend, things that have been there forever because I just couldn’t bear to do them, and they weren’t even that hard. This is huge for me, after suffering with the fatigue and moodiness for so long. I know it’s early days and we’ll see how I continue to do with it. But these last few days I feel some hope for the first time in a while. Sending you hope and support. There are treatments out there for what we’re going through. 🫶",
  "For me, it's more blinding rage and anger over every perceived injustice. My already black and white thinking has become even not so. I was similar as a young teenager in puberty, trending towards anger and never years. I'm on HRT and it's not quite as bad, but I'm still in Peri so I'm having wild hormone swings. Before I realized it was peri, I literally thought I was going insane. \n\n\nIn the first year of peri, before I realized the problem, I got so fed up at a not great situation at an otherwise good employer that I moved halfway across the the country for the first job offer I got. Now, I've spent almost two years in a toxic work environment in a city I hate. I was getting by, but after three weeks of rage, last week, I made the \"mistake\" of speaking out, so I've killed any career advancement here. Nothing I said should have killed my career, my boss told me I was 100% correct and not unprofessional, but it's toxic here and I can read between the lines. So I'm off relocation repayment clauses now and I'm searching and going to relocate again, but who knows when the job market will allow that.\n\n\nAnyway, HRT helps but it's not enough. Knowing part of my problem is hormonal helps but it's not enough. I'm hoping my next place is less toxic so it will be enough, because hormones or not, my feelings are real and I have limited support and am getting so, so tired of endless struggle.",
  "Yup. 40f. If I didn't know it was peri, I would have thought i was having a mental breakdown. HRT has helped with my moods the most, and I'm amost there on sleep as I find my proper dosage.",

  "Yeah, I have those days where everything makes me cry.",
  "Yes.  A resounding yes.  I cry at the drop of a hat and then I’m raging inside my brain.  I can’t figure out what emotion I’m feeling on any given day.  I have a lot on my plate right now and I think I’d rather run into a burning building than deal with the problems of life.  \nYou have options and it’s best to have an honest conversation with your GP.",
  "Yep.",
  "Thank you for posting ❤.\n\n\nI empathise completely, I felt really bad last year, felt that I had lost it completely and was unable to do much just survive from June to November last year. Then I realised I was in perimenopause and began therapy, followed by HRT. I am not there yet but feel so much better just knowing it is peri and that oestrogen is responsible for this hot mess of a situation!",
  "get your hormone levels checked by someone who actually knows what they're looking for. My outlook on life improved significantly when I started topical estradiol + HRT. I wish for my kids' sake as well as my own that I'd known about both of those things a decade ago",
  "okay fellow vagina owners, 24 years ago I had my first child- long labor forceps delivery- and from that point on I could not keep a diaphragm or a tampon in. I would discuss it with my doctors but they just looked at me confused and told me my diaphragm was the right size. I also had some hideous pain that would randomly show up, typically waking me in the middle of the night, that felt like a hot wire wrapped around my tailbone and then dull pain spreading up my anus and my vagina. I told them about that too, for two dozen years, and always got the blank look and then the next question.\n\nthankfully, one of the many many nights this pain woke me up, I was Googling a collection of words that described my symptoms- as one does at 2:00 a.m. - and discovered the answer right on Reddit!! It was pudendal nerve pain/ damage, likely from the forceps, and could be greatly helped with pelvic floor therapy. I wish I could find the person who made that post and hug them \n\nso here I am at 58, getting pelvic floor therapy- my current doctor made sure to write the referral so I could see the office of my choice + have no problem with the number of visits, and she made note of what I was talking about. I can only hope this will help someone else down the line.\n\nBack to the subject line- I have done a great deal of work with my transverse abdominis and other abdominal muscles, per my pt. I've discovered that my pelvic floor was in a permanent state of tightness while also being incredibly weak. Now it's all loosened up. I've done enough of the various Kegel exercises- elevators, blueberries, flicks but they are hard!, whatever you call the squeeze and stand, and more. But I am still unable to keep even the lightest - using Intimate Rose, the white one - weight in if I stand up. \n\nI used to weight lift so I understand that developing muscles is not an instant thing but I cannot get past the fact that this thing just blurps right out, the same way my diaphragm and any attempt to use a tampon used to be back in the day when I needed those. I have actually cried on my husband's shoulder about this.\n\nany words of encouragement? anyone else going through the same thing?\n\nalso for what it's worth, I don't see a tag for pelvic floor and I kind of feel like we should have one ❤️ how do we go about adding a tag?",
  "Thank you for your post.\n\nYour post has already helped one person. It's a light bulb moment for me.  I have been struggling with the most excruciating tail bone pain since my sons forceps delivery 11 years ago. I have seen numerous doctors have had lots of examinations, even a colonoscopy, but no one has ever suggested this. I just googled it, and I have most of the symptoms.",
  "I have no advice, I just wanted to commend your onomatopoeial prowess with beautiful deployment of \"blurp\".",
  "I don’t have any experience with this- but I want to thank you so much for sharing. This is good information and likely to be helpful to others. I had no idea that forceps could cause nerve damage - and horrified (but not surprised) that your doctors shrugged it off for decades!! I also didn’t know that it could cause a tampon to just fall out!\n\nI am so glad you are finally getting treatment! \n\nI had PT for my lower abs - damaged during a c-section and I had absolutely no sensation in the muscles at all! They did wake up eventually with work - and hopefully the same will be true for you with the pelvic floor muscles.",
  "I had significant life impacting issues after I had my daughter 16 years ago. Biggest was fecal incontinence. My obs sent me to pt. After pt it was better but everything felt “off”. Dr completely dismissed. Lived like this for another year then researched found another ob, turns out all of my muscles posteriorly tore. Skin was intact but that was it. Had surgery and everything is pretty much normal now. 3 Drs and physical therapist didn’t notice I guess. But also couldn’t use a tampon etc.",
  "What does your PT say?\n\nLay on your bed, and squeeze while gently slowly pulling on the weight.  Use your breath, focus on sensations, be patient.",

  "I am so sorry you have dealt with the issues for so long. I also had a four step delivery resulting in significant nerve pain that eventually cleared. However, I did have to have reconstructive surgery for them to rebuild my perineum. The old expression, hot dog down the hallway, that was me.\n\nA uro-gynecologist put Humpty Dumpty back together again about 8 weeks after the birth of my daughter. It did require quite a bit of me advocating for myself that the results of my bottom was not normal and I was not going to live with it.",

  "I’m so glad you finally found the right support and are working with a pelvic floor therapist 🙌 If the Ivory weight is too heavy right now, don’t worry! A great starting point is practicing with it while sitting down instead of standing. If that’s still too challenging, try using it while lying down. After a week or two of incorporating these adjustments, you’ll likely notice improvements and be able to start trying them again while standing. It’s a gradual process, and just like weightlifting, building muscle strength takes time. Keep going, and know that you’re not alone in this! 💜",
  "A specially trained physio told me those weights are not evidence based. Keep up the pf exercises and notice function. Pessary, surgery are options if the pain persists and the exercises don’t fully fix. Keep persisting for the best quality of life! Xx",

    "So after a long 13 years in a sexless marriage of 18 years, and a long protracted divorce, I found the girl of my dreams.  We have been dating for 2 years now.  We have separate houses but live together most of the time.  Her positive upbeat attitude matched mine, and we communicated very well.  For the first 18 months, we never fought, we might get our feelings hurt or something, but we would talk about it, and we both made concessions and compromises and apologized and moved on.  We really learned from each other, what we needed, what we wanted, and how to love one another.  \n\nThen Perimenopause started about 6 months ago and everything changed. First thing I noticed was she went from glass half full to complaining about everything, her skin, her weight gain, people at work, her friends.  I can't really explain it, but it was like a switch was flipped.  It was almost overnight.  One day we are our happy lives like normal, the next she's curled up in a ball crying on the couch because I told her it was too late to go to the store at 9pm for ice cream (it had just closed).  \n\nThe other thing that happened right away was that she would start yelling at me for something that usually wouldn't bother her like changing my body wash flavor.  They were out of what I usually use so I tried a different flavor, and she said it was gagging her, and caused a fight about how I could make such a big change without talking to her first.  We have been fighting pretty regularly the last few months.  \n\nWe used to have daily sex and indulging in her sexual proclivities on the weekends, she was into some things I had never tried, but I embraced and start to enjoy on my own.  She was very high libido, and I had to get my self into better shape just to keep up with her.  Sex is kind of a big deal for me because of my marriage.  Part of that light switch was our sex life, because we might have sex now 1 or 2 times a month, and its sometimes just a half hearted handy.  None of it is passionate she doesn't want to get off herself, she just wants to get me off and get it over with, which just makes it harder for me.  We don't partake in any of the racier stuff she turned me on to at all. While her diminished libido is slightly problematic I think I could handle that if it was the only thing, but I am noticing that she is less affectionate too.  No more cuddling, no random kisses, no more sitting right next to me and holding my hand while watch tv.  \n\nLastly she's drinking an unhealthy amount, 5-10 beers a night almost every night, weekends are at the higher end, and I often have to help her to bed.  This leads her to be hung over most mornings and more combative.  She has a hard time getting out of bed for work, and sleeps in on the weekends, which I am okay with generally speaking.  \n\nLast night she told me I need to move on and find someone better, someone who deserves me, and younger that will want to cuddle and have sex all the time.  I am still being very supportive, take her on dates, and buy her presents and flowers quite often.  I am an expert at staying calm and minimizing the arguments, because of my experience with my ex.  Is the girl I met a few years ago going to come back.  I would gladly hang on, and work through it, but I'm scared that I am back in a relationship like I had in my marriage where I was always on eggshells and holed up in my home office working to avoid the fights.  ",
    "My heart breaks reading this! For you, but also mostly for her because I know the total unravelling she is experiencing and it is terrifying and sad and dark. Maintaining my cozy, loving and sexy relationship with a wonderful man was my main trigger to get my peri sorted out mentally, physically, emotionally, psychologically and sexually. \n\nIt took two years to find the balance again and who knows what will go awry as I move closer to full meno. HRT plus testosterone and vaginal estrogen combined with lifestyle changes is what’s working, plus a commitment to myself and my partner to stay connected. He’s helping me by being supportive and compassionate, but I am the one that has to save myself, basically. It’s lonely and very difficult but it’s working and I feel good and strong and my relationship is growing and I look forward to the future again. I hope she finds the will to save herself and by extension your relationship 🩷 Take care of her and yourself!!",
    "It sounde like she needs to find a counselor and a doctor that will take her seriously and try hormone replacement therapy.  The excesive drinking isn't healthy, she's probably aware and using it as a coping mechanism for her changes, it's also going to dehydrate her and escalate the issues, hang overs are going to escalate the issues.  \n\nI'm not a \"you need to leave!\" Kind of guy. I like that my wife is my age. I couldn't imagine dating a 30 something while I'm 45. What do you talk about? \"I love this song we jammed to it at college\" and getting a \"yea, I remember that when I was in elementary school too\". So much is out of context with big age gaps. \n\nThat being said, you're not married and men hold the keys to commitment in the relationship.  For the love of God, don't get married while these issues are presen. At the moment your needs are not being met, while it's understandable that as she's changing, she has to sort out her new body and it's reactions. She taking issues and blowing them up to a level 10 emergency, when realistically it's a level 2 annoyance. Getting shit on for new body wash? A \"Hey, can I get/you get something different? This one is really strong and isn't setting well with my nose\" is an appropriate adult response. \n\nMy wife started perimenopause in the last year and it's a roller coaster. I feel like I've it's a weird reverse puberty she and I are dealing with. Like you, I had a marriage that wasn't healthy and one of the things I loved was the frequency of, and type of sex my wife and I have and that's changing. I stay strong, I believe I need to be her rock to hold steady when she's losing her mind with hot flashes, and hormones rising and dropping, dealing with body changes (it's tmi but she hates that she doesn't get wet and we need to use lube, that she's sensitive and not in a good way it's a ouch that's sensitive way) so I'm accepting that sex is going down in frequency and it's more vanilla. I have hope that it'll come around again, but.\n\nSo long way to come to this idea. She changing, she knows it. You know it. Was the beginning, the lust stage of the relationship, her being authentic? Was she expressing things in your love language, the intimacy, cuddling, snuggles, etc, because it's her love language also or because it's what she saw you wanted and was essentially placating you? Those seem to be off the table right now, and I know menopause can change the body, maybe touch right now is over stimulating, but there needs to be accommodations for each of your needs. To me a half hearted handy is sad, I'd rather just jerk off then feel like I'm an inconvenience.",
    "I experienced this problem together with my awesome GF (50f). As I would always do with my ex or my GF when she was still menstruating, I would always do my best to help her and let her know that, just because she was experiencing hormonal changes, of course I would never accuse her of being irrational or ‘moody’ or anything like that. And the same thing would go for my GF’s experiences with menopause. But it’s tough, because there’s SO much mixed up with it - she never had kids, she doesn’t really know what to expect so she’s scared, she feels guilty about blowing up at me. And sure there are times when I need to bite my lip. But she recently started hormone replacement and it seems to be helping. I love her so much and I do my best not to let my feelings be affected by her frustrations. \n\nI wish you a lot of luck, OP. I hope you can find a way to move on together.",
    "She’s in a spiral and part of that is her coming to grips with how things are right now.. doesn’t mean it’s going to be like that for ever. The main thing is she feels she can’t be who you want (hence saying move on) she not only has to figure it out in her head and understand her whole hormonal change and upheaval, as well as worry about you and your relationship together. My advice would be, let her know you are there, don’t push topics until she wants to talk about them otherwise it just ends angrily. Do your usual daily stuff and ask if she wants to come with etc? But if she doesn’t then give that space. I can guarantee you she’s aware of how things are and she not know how to talk about it as it’s thrown her completely. It’s a bit shit..but look for the fun moments and it’s gets alot better",
    "After 18 years of celibacy I would cut bait on this one. Mean, but we all have our own path to follow.",
    "I feel like the more I want to discuss stuff, the more I make her angry. If I'm quiet and small, it seems like things are better. There is no right opinion, we have to be as invisible as possible. ",
    "Yup. Sometimes that's the best way to be. You're not alone in that feeling at all.",
    "Shutting down communication won't help anything, unless it's in the face of bad behavior. If they've gone off the rails, then gently remove yourself from the situation. Don't engage with the crazy. It's not a 24/7 thing for most women, so don't punish her the rest of the time for shit the estrogen starved gremlin inside her says and does.",
    "Unfortunately I found just letting them know you are when they come to terms with it is best way. The sane way of a friend wants to talk about a problem or addiction, the whole peri menopause issue carries some shame/embarrassment with it..it shouldn’t and we are caring partners..but it has to be when they want to talk and understand it in their heads. My wife had denial for ages and I just left it alone..now she’s more receptive and says things like oh my friend said xyz, and you have to act surprised whilst trying to not roll your eyes as you’ve been saying it for months lol",
    "I don’t know that I’d say, “Communicate Less,” but rather, “Pick Your Battles,” but every household is different. Sometimes my wife is in the mood to discuss certain things, and other times she isn’t.",
    "This makes me laugh.    My husband has ADHD and sometimes will just blather on and on about whatever.   My tolerance for listening to him blather on is very low these days ..  I try and tell him but then he forgets ..and I just leave the room for some silence. Lol I don't think this is what you mean though",
    "Watch non verbal communication as well, I got killed on Friday for her interpretation of the look on my face instead of what I was saying during a \"normal\" night out.",
    "Lot to be said for choosing what to discuss. This is called taking things off her plate.",
    "My wife has turned into another person. She is always looking for a fight. If I do not engage or reply to her hurtful comments she is perfectly capable of escalating the situation herself. If I do try to engage and show compassion or engage in a discussion that also escalates things. \n\nIf I distance myself so that I remove myself from the equation that also upsets her. \n\nI am feeling so confused as nothing I do or say is right rather whatever I do or say it is wrong. \n\nRight now I am trying to not attach myself to her behaviour and just tough it up and wait it all out but I have also made preparations so that I can manage taking care of the kids myself. \n\nHow have others managed to get through a decade of their partner acting this way?",
    "Super curious about responses you get also. My partner is entering perimenopause also. I feel like educating myself has helped, which your obviously doing too. It's tough but our support means more to them than they sometimes give us credit for. Hang in there, boss. Keep reaching out and making self-care a priority.",
    "Couples' therapy? Yes the rage comes from hormones but sometimes there's a big ball of stuff women are used to push down that they can no longer do with hormonal rage. Sometimes it takes help to untangle the emotions that have built over the years and pushed to the bottom of our psyche. Untill it's done, anything and everything is likely to be the target of her rage.",
    "Its true. You have to assume that your wife is changing, and after peri she will be another person. Thats what hormones do.\nThink when you are a teeneager, from kid to man.  Peri is the same and she is suffering too.\nSo, be patience, compasive and read a lot about perimenopause.",
    "It’s hard not to take the changes personally I think. And having to be constantly on guard against triggers, (that you only find by stepping on them,) gets to be stressful. \n\nGuys are “fixers,” so I find it difficult to reign in the, “I must fix this” attitude,” but there’s really nothing to fix. Just listen, be there when needed and take care of yourself. \n\nIn a way, it’s been an opportunity for me to better myself. In some ways I’ve changed, (being more sensitive to needs, help around the house, exercise, eating healthier and reduced drinking.) All positive I think. Awareness is a big one. \n\nThis whole menopause thing is like a metamorphosis, and I just hope she’ll still want me to stick around when the storm is over.",
    "Is she on HRT? I highly recommend her to start exploring these options. I became a raging brioche when Peri kicked in and it eventually turned into self hatred (seriously look out for that, too) and once I got onto the correct HRT regiment I became a normal rational human being again. \nThis is a shxt time. Seriously, she knows she’s a total monster, too, (even if she can’t admit it, YET) and it’s HARD to self regulate emotions when you barely recognize yourself. It’s like your body and your brain are taking over control of the ride and you are strapped into your seat watching everything happen with horror. It’s hell.",
    "Understanding and support for her. You also have to do alot of work on yourself.\nRemember it's not your fault. Try not to get angry. Don't engage in the arguments.  Practice some self love. Meditation and yoga has helped me. I'm at 11 years now. It's so tiring....",
    "Some antidepressants help with hot flashes…. Life changing.",
    "Sorry this is gonna be a long ass post, but the background as I think about it and reflect on a post in the perimenopause subreddit about past trauma exacerbating the peri symptoms all ties together for us...\n\nThis is my 2nd marriage, first one fell apart to her having a mental breakdown and getting into drugs. My current wife was my best friend in 9th grade, the last person I danced at a school dance with ever and we stayed real close until like 11th grade. My best friend since kindergarten had a locker next to her and told her every day how much I liked her. I was friend zone...Fast forward to 2009, she left her husband and I was still single after my divorce. It started as a facebook message from her and then 2 old friends meeting for lunch and here we are today. I just turned 48 and she will be 48 in April.\n\nAfter being together for a bit and getting engaged in 2010, we decided to make a big change and start fresh, we moved to Cali in 2011 and stayed there until Covid showed up and took my old man's life. At her direction, we decided we should move back in 2020 to help my sisters and mom out and to be closer to her parents who had been divorced since the late-ish 1990s. We came home for every Chrstmas and spent the time split 50-50 with staying at my family's house and her mom's.\n\nWe bought a really nice house, still needed a bunch of work and our animal family expanded from 1 dog and 4 cats to 2 dogs and currently at 9 (soon to be 7) cats. I have a step-son, in 2010 she had a partial hysterectomy, so she wasn't able to have anymore - it didn't bother me, I loved her. Also during all of this and pre-dating us as a couple, she was hurt at work (back) and it worsened over the years. She has now had 2 fusions and is permanently disabled. For about 10 years, she was on a ton of opioids to \"control\" the pain, she has been off them for about 1 year as of now. She is now using THC and a few other meds to control the pain along with an anti-depressant.  She is in constant pain, but has good days and bad days with it...\n\nPerimenopause came up at around Sept 2023 at her annual physical and I don't think anything could prepare us for where we are now. It explained a few symptoms she was mildly experiencing, hot flashes some brain fog, some sexual discomfort. At Thanksgiving, everyone in my family and her mother always comes to our house for the big holidays, that was the tradition we started when we moved back in 2020. We noticed her mom was a little forgetful, but she played it off and we didn't think much about it, she was 69 at the time. By Christmas it was a different story, her mother couldn't cut her food and had trouble moving, she would freeze and not be able to move and her memory was much worse.   \n\nMy wife spent a few nights at her mom's to help her and we realized she couldn't be on her own. We attempted to move her in and it lasted a few days before we had to send her to the hospital in an ambulance, my wife cried a lot that day. She was eventually released and after a bunch of back and forth and in and outs of the hospital and rehab facilities, ended up in a long- term nursing home for Parkinson's and vascular dementia. I was of course there for my wife and helped every way I could. \n\nHer mom is a complicated woman, she would smile at your face and talk behind your back, she could be nice but also very vindictive to those she didn't like or crossed her. My wife has a brother and 2 sisters and basically only my wife and 1 sister was talking to her mom when we moved back. The would go for mani/pedis, out to lunch or the 3 of us would go out to dinner. When her mom would visit her sister and niece in Florida, my wife would watch her mom's 3 cats (which joined our home). During this time, she surrendered one of the cats to the vets office as he just sprayed constantly. As her mother was becoming forgetful, she never had him neutered.  I remember my wife calling me from the vet's office where they recommended that he be an only cat, they had a shelter and would adopt him out. She wasn't sure what to do, she didn't want him spraying in our house, but she felt bad. I told her that I support whatever decision she makes - she surrendered him and he was adopted a couple weeks later. He was a cool guy...\n\nWhen she ended up in the nursing home, my wife and her mom signed power of attorney and health care proxy paperwork. My wife really struggled with all of this and then we had to empty her place, she reached out to her siblings 2 of which who wanted nothing to do with their mom and were at least a little helpful in packing and moving her stuff. My wife was also basically estranged from her 1 sister and brother, naturally they started talking and re-forming relationships - they also discussed all of their childhood trauma's and emotional abuse from their mother, it seems my wife kept those feelings tucked far away and memories as well. From February up through July, you could see my wife was starting to experience some of the emotional pain from back then mixed in with her growing peri symptoms. In July it was our 15th anniversary, she flipped out on the 4th and just disappeared and told me off for no reason. I had to cancel our 4th of July plans literally an hour before everyone was coming over.  It was also the last time she even talked to her mom, at that point it was fuck her she's dead to me and she is getting what she deserves. I was like huh? A few weeks later she opened up about how her mother called her a slut and a bunch of other name calling through her early teen years until she was like 21 or so. She opened up about the same stuff that happened with her sibling and mom as well. \n\nShe hasn't seen or spoken to her mom since July, only responding to phone calls from the nursing home and/or hospital if she has to go there from falling. For us it has been wildy up and and down and today I'm just not sure anymore...\n\nI also found out she was raped when she was 16, she was tied down by a firefighter she knew and others just stood there and did nothing. I was horrified, she cried, I held her, listened to her, told her it wasn't her fault and I'd always be there for her. \n\nIn July it was decided that she need her 2nd back surgery, she had the ability to pick the date. We talked and it was a good conversation, I asked how long she thinks she could wait it out, since we had a lot of house projects that needed to get wrapped up before fall. I asked if she could make it until the end of September and timing that she'd be recovered before the holiday's, she wanted it done ASAP, so early August it was. I took 2 weeks off of work and worked half days the 3rd week to care for her and our furry family while she was recovering enough to take the dogs out. I handled everything, laundry, cooking, shopping, cleaning etc. But I obviously couldn't handle it all when I went back to work...\n\nWe had a really big argument in October and I was ready to end it. She was talking to someone we knew and said she had feelings for him. She claimed that it wasn't like that, but they stopped talking the 3 of us stopped hanging out etc., I almost pulled the plug on us then. She showed me the messages and all of that ended, she wept apologized and all that stuff. Everything was going very well until Early February this year and now the wheels are really coming off. I caught the flu at work and a bad cold after and she caught both. We went out for my birthday dinner with family and she was getting worse, I asked her to make herself a Dr appt and she made one at like 630 pm, I would be home and be able to take her, she was too worn out to go on her own. I come home, massive rage and uncontrollable anger.  She went on her own, diagnosed with pneumonia and she came home and tried to pack a bag and leave, she left bruises on both of my arms - she was fine during the day. I can't even begin to describe how uncontrollable her rage was - it was bordering on insanity. \n\nThroughout the July time frame through now, one of our cat's started to spray as they began to not like one of her mom's cats. We had a few discussions and my advice was for her to re-home her mother's other 2 cats. I get blamed for doing nothing, and as I reminded her they are your mother's cats you made the call and worked to re-home the one, you need to be the one to do the same for these 2 (my sister found them a home together with a family my brother in law knows - they leave Tuesday). I didn't know how much of an issue it really was for my wife as she would go from anger and rage one day about nothing to being \"normal\" the next.  Apparently, I was wrong and this is a big issue for her. Was hard to tell as she goes through the persi symptoms. You don't know what's a real issue or not, as it comes and goes with her symptoms. \n\nLast week, I came home and she showed me so I knew, that she looked at the sex offender registry and searched the guy who raped her out and pulled up the article where we has arrested by he FBI for trying to get with his family friend's 14 yr old daughter. She seemed fine, was very open honest and didn't seem unstable or upset.\n\nOn Wednesday she went to the Dr to go over her peri symtpoms and she was prescribed an HRT estrogen vaginal ointment, which she picked up on Friday and used for the first time last night. She's waiting for another script, that needed some work and changes due to insurance BS.   \n\n\nYesterday, was a red rage day, our cat sprayed on a window while I was on the phone with her and she flipped. I told her you need to re-home the cats, she did, and that I would make ours a vet appointment, I did - top get him checked out and to see if they recommend meds. She went off on the cat and he peed on her pillow and that obviously started WW3. She was raging all day. On the way home she asked if we could go out to dinner, we did and she was normal, we went to the mall after, all normal. Stepped foot in the house and the rage and anger started again, she slept in our spare room with the dogs. \n\nToday we are in separate rooms drinking coffee, I got up first, she said she wasn't coming down but she wasn't mad at me when I asked if she was. I ask if she's in the mood to go grocery shopping as we do every Saturday, she say's she wants to go. She gets a call from weird number and picks up, it's the nursing home, her mom has a rash that has gotten real bad and the nurse says it's starting to spread and blister, my wife tells the nurse, it must be the evil trying to escape, you can take her to whatever hospital you want. I didn't say a word, but was like WTF. We showered together, she seemed fine still, I said look if you feel like therapy is need for you or for us, let me know - we can make it work. Her eyes welled up and she said she doesn't want to talk about it. I said honey, we have to, she said I never went my self, maybe that might help I'm not sure. I got out of the shower and got ready to go as did she.  All was normal while we were out, we went to Petsmart for stuff for the dogs and cats, she was helpful and nice. We got home, she was doing well. Put groceries away, pet stuff away. I started doing dishes she said stop I'll get that, so you can go clean and change the litter boxes out, I did and she did all was fine. She started to vacuum and she's said it isn't sucking well, I asked if she checked the filters....and there it was insanity rage, she storms out the house and yells I'm buying a new vacuum slams the door and speeds off. She returns with lowes boxes, packs her clothes and belongings and moves into the spare room. Says I have 30 days to fix the cat issue or shes moving out. She has no fucks to give anymore, this isn't a life I want. I'd get rid of every animal and this house today if I could.  She even yelled at her baby (our small dog) and said keep it up and I'll through you out of the house., he is her whole life. She also spent all day yesterday and today arguing with people on Facebook about Trump...\n\nLooking back over the past year, she has delved more into social media, Facebook and instagram reels all day long, Tick tock constantly. It's like she lost her self in that realm as well and her peri symptoms are just off the charts. Constant hot flashes, no sleeping at night, bladder control issues, head aches, memory issues, brain fog, muscle and joint aches, inability to concentrate. She soaked our cats iron skillet in water to clean it...\n\nIt's like she took all of her pain throughout her life and everything came out with the perimenopause and reflected every bit of anger and insane rage at my the cats, the dogs and the house.I have been empathetic, there for her, I went like 4 months without sex, didn't give her that much of a hard time becuase I knew she was struggling. It puts me in a no win situation, there is nothing I can do, expect what I read on how to be there for her, but fuck it's hard when you are the focus of it all...",
    "😞😞😞💔 this is more than perimenopause obviously… I’m so sorry. Is therapy an option at all?This doesn’t sound sustainable for anyone. You deserve better. Her trauma doesn’t excuse this behavior ratching out of control.",
    "TLDR?",
    "Sorry, OP.  Sounds like classic Perimenopause raging at everything and everyone in proximity. The taking you for granted when you do all this extra stuff by talking with some other man and developing feelings for him.  Women at this stage in their life start to exhibit Insane decision making. Like oh some other man finds me attractive? I must explore this more even though I am married to a wonderful man already. It’s like they have to invent some sort of drama because their life isn’t hard enough.\n\nGet rid of all the cats for sure. That many cats in one house is very overwhelming and stressful.",
    "After speaking with a perimenopause specialist, I’ve learned that this stage can be a roller coaster for our wives—mentally, physically, and emotionally. As men, we may not fully understand what’s happening, but we can support them through it.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\t•\tPerimenopause can last up to 10 years, with fluctuating estrogen levels causing mood swings, sleep issues, low energy, and a drop in libido.\n\n\t•\tSome women experience mild changes, while others feel completely overwhelmed. Stress, responsibilities in, and hormonal shifts can make things worse.\n\nWays I can be supportive:\n\t•\tPrioritize Sleep – Poor sleep is a huge factor. Estrogen affects sleep quality, and lack of rest can create a snowball effect on mood, energy, and overall health. Magnesium, melatonin, and proper timing of hormone therapy can help.\n\n\t•\tSupport Her Mental Health – Depression and anxiety can hit hard. Hormone therapy may help, but lifestyle changes like reducing stress, improving diet, and regular exercise are crucial.\n\n\t•\tBe Patient with Intimacy – A drop in libido is common. Many women don’t want to be touched, which isn’t about you, but their changing hormones. Estrogen, progesterone, and even testosterone therapy can help. More importantly, maintaining emotional closeness—hugs, conversations, small gestures—goes a long way.\n\n\t•\tEncourage Breaks Without Guilt – Women often push through responsibilities while in fight-or-flight mode. A short getaway or time alone to reset can be a game-changer.\n\nMy Key Takeaway: \nPerimenopause is a phase, and there is light at the end of the tunnel. With understanding and patience, I can help my wife come out stronger—and my relationship will, too.\n\nIf you’ve gone through this with your partner, what helped the most? Let’s support each other in this.",

    "As a peri woman I support this post!  🙌🏻 I think it’s great that you’ve approached a peri specialist, you’ve put yourself in the best place for both your wife and for you both.

    "I was over on another menopause thread and some of the people there were talking about Wisp’s OMG cream and some other “scream creams”.

",
    "I paid $65+ for a bottle, L-arginine is the main ingredient along with sildenafil. (Sidenafil 1%, Theophylline 3%, Arginine 6%). It feels “spicy” probably due to the peppermint oil, but doesn’t really help finish the job. 3/10⭐️",

Probably compounding pharmacy but my wife is sick of going to the doctor for every little thing.

Couldn’t touch wife down there for a while and is very much needed even on top of HRT. Just use it after sex or a few hours before. I don’t think the potency is enough to affect us negatively but I’d rather err on the side of caution.",

This is the truth, and you need to recognize what it is. The only hope is a combination of therapy and HRT.  Good luck, fellas.",

    "Yes she still says I love you, and gives me Kisses in the morning, get home from work, and goodnight. but If I get overly affectionate she really gets annoyed by it and flatly rejects me.",
    "Update from my previous post last month. \n\nI am really struggling with how to proceed with my wife.  Every interaction with me is met with defensiveness.  She is completely checked out of our marriage aside from the day to day things that need to be done.  Says that she does not care to work on our marriage or relationship until she figures out what she wants out of life, or figures out how to be happy with the life she has made.  She still refuses to further address her hormones before her next appointment in April. So frustrating because I see it clear as day, she needs an estrogen patch badly. Its to the point where she barely wants any interaction with our children. Logic says that if your hormones have brought you to this mid life crisis, then addressing your hormones is going to help bring you out of it. How you can find joy in your life or make any rational decisions about your life if your messed up hormones are the dominating the narrative? \n\nNothing has really changed. She is still extremely withdrawn from me. She is still in a mid-life crisis about being unfulfilled in her life. She doesn't want to engage with me as a husband and partner. We've had discussions about how I feel like I just don't have a partner in this marriage anymore. She said that me and my needs are just too much right now.  She only says that she has to work on herself, and come to terms with the life she has made. Her mood swings and irritability are at an all time high, being on Progesterone only isn't cutting it. She talks about our life as though everything is a burden on her, and that its never going to change or get better. She acts like she is a victim of her own circumstances. Instead of doing the hard work and facing these life stressors head on and finding a way to make them more manageable. \n\nI've asked her to think about and lets explore how we make our life better, what does that look like to her. Nothing about our situation is written in stone, there are no bad ideas. Do we switch up our routine to allow more free time on the weekends, do we switch up the kid's swim lesson's schedule to make it in the middle of the week instead of Sundays?  Do we need to plan a small family getaway for spring break here in a couple months? Does that look like a weekly outing to a new restaurant on Saturdays regardless of what the kids will eat? Just to have something new to look forward to. Does she just need one day a week where she isn't involved with us at all?  She instead takes every opportunity to run from her problems, shields herself away, withdrawl.  She takes every opportunity she can to escape our family. She just spent this past Saturday going to her friend's daughters cheer-leading competition for the day. They went to lunch prior to the competition, and then spent the next 4 hours waiting to watch her friend's daughter's squad do their 6 minute performance, then spent another 2 hours chatting at a coffee shop.  I don't begrudge her spending time with her friends.  But she had the audacity to tell me not to take our 2 daughters out to do something fun because it only reinforces that dad is the fun parent.  I told her that is you problem, you want to go off and tag along with your girlfriend for the day and do her family activity that's your choice. We aren't going to sit around here and do nothing to protect your feelings of inadequacy. So I took our kids to see a movie they were really wanting to see in the theater. \n\nI have a strong feeling that at some point she is going to ask me for a break. Now what that means, I am not sure. Is it is a separation? Is it sleep in separate bedrooms and just be co-parents for a while? That seems very unproductive. I'm not sure how I would respond to this type of request.  Heck for the most part it fills like a break already, she spends most her free time and nights shut in our room, reading books, journaling, trying to connecting with her spirit guides, talking to all her friends about her and our problems.   I am not sure I could grant an actual separation when she hasn't even addressed her hormones, or even tried couples therapy.  Her counselor even offered to start having us come in for a few sessions as a couple to which I would be totally down for.  She told her no that she wasn't ready to discuss our marriage issues before she works out what she wants out of life. I want to be like sorry dear, you don't get to quit when you haven't done anything to address your issue.  But that's a potential problem for a future me. \n\nOn a positive note I have been working very hard at being a good listener and holding space, and being empathetic when she talks about things in hopes that she will begin to share things with me again. I wasn't not a in good place in my own life 6 months ago when she shared with me that she was going through perimenopause and in a mid-life crisis. I certainly did some damage there in my ability to be a safe space for her to share things.  This past week on Friday she shared with me that she is really getting into a more spiritual journey and trying to connect to her spirit guides, recognizing signs from the universe vs coincidences. Tapping into energy, astrology, taro cards. That type of stuff.  Things she was kind of into before we met, and even led her to me.   It was a good and fascinating conversation, I actually began to get watery-eyed in the middle of it because I seen just how excited she was with all this stuff, and I seen a spark of joy there that hasn't been present in awhile.  I told her it was all very interesting, and I was happy that she has found something to dig into like this.  I don't judge her on it as I believe that type of spiritual genre just is just as valid as being a Christian. I'm pretty agnostic, people just need a belief system to help them cope with the harsh realities of life and that's fine by me.  But I was very happy that my work to be more emotionally safe has paid off and she is opening more towards me. It pains me greatly that my wife did not see me as safe to open up to and be vulnerable with. \n\nI have been spending my time working on myself too, as I was at an all time low point in my life last year dealing with a chronic medical issue that spiraled out of control and needed surgery. It certainly took the wind out of my sails for the past year and now that I am fully recovered, I am reclaiming my own life as well. I've lost 25lbs in the past 3 months through fasting and weight training, and feeling great about myself and just starting to reinvest time in my own happiness.  When you spend the majority of a year in chronic pain, you get to the point where you just can't show up in your life outside of the minimum effort required to make it through the day.  Once that pain was gone, you realize just how terrible your existence was.  I have been doing alot of self reflecting about my mental state during that period and giving myself alot of self compassion for what I went through; as I couldn't give myself any compassion while in the throws of it.  Yes I got super insecure over all this 6 months ago.  The menopause, lack of affection, no sex, a sudden change in our relationship.  But that insecurity doesn't define me, anybody in my situation would have gone through some major insecurity or panic after your spouse drops a bomb in your lap that threatens your emotional safety net when your just trying to survive. Everybody goes through insecurity, and I have been doing daily affirmations about what I know is true in my life. What type of man I am, what bring to a relationship, the type of father I am, the type of partner I am, how I show up in a relationship. All the wonderful things that make me the man I am.   I could easily choose to believe in the negative thoughts and allow that insecurity to take over again, and most assuredly behave in a manner that would drive her away completely.  Or I can change my perspective and change my life.  I know she loves me, I have all the evidence to support that, hell just the other day she came out down the hall way in her bathrobe to grab something before hopping in the shower, and I cheekily requested that she flash me to which she gruffed, and turned around gave me peek. So I know she isn't done with us. She feels trapped in her life, she actually isn't.  She has her own accounts, she has plenty of money, she could leave anytime she wants. Probably has had those thoughts too.  But she didn't. She has chosen to stay thus far, and not completely destroy our marriage over her hormones and mid life crisis behaviors.  Even though she has all these destructive and intrusive thoughts, all this irritability and frustration toward me and how her life has turned out, making some extremely questionable choices that are like self sabotage. It must mean that she also has a deep love for me, and for our family that overrides all this stuff. Sometimes the crazy stuff wins the battle for the day, but if I want win the whole war. I gotta lean into that deep love, give her the space she needs, love her from afar, support her when its needed, sometimes just go with the flow, and most of all don't react to the crazy.   That don't mean be a push over, stand up for yourself when a boundary is crossed, but just don't match her crazy emotions with your own crazy emotions.  Set your expectations for what you need, and ask her to honor them when she can. \n\n If I I am able to do that then we'll probably be alright on the other side of this.  If she decides that she's done with this life and marriage or does something unforgivable like any type of infidelity, then I win either way as I know i will have done right by my own soul, and will be free to find the life I couldn't find with her.  There is plenty of equity in our house value, and everything would have to be split down the middle anyways so its not like I am in any danger of having to start over life with nothing, and the kids would have to be 50/50 anyways.  It would suck, and definitely not something I would want and would fight like hell to avoid it, but if that is reality then so be it.   \n\n",

Then I noticed some of the other changes that she wouldn't talk about such as drastic mood swings, being super emotional then cold as ice, her irrational decision making, brain fog, vaginal issues,etc. I spoke with a friend's wife and she told me about perimenopause, finally I had a name, and I did a deep dive to understand what she was dealing with.\nTo be honest my wife dropped the \"divorce bomb\" on me, but at the time I knew she was heavily dealing with her PM. But we still talked, we still had sex, I tried to reassure her, and kept trying to do the small things to let her know I was here and I cared. But it got worse. Her symptoms just kept getting worse.\n\nShe has since stopped talking to me about her health and about what's going on with her even though we are in the same house and I am still showing I care. She hasn't done anything as far as filed, and I certainly holding out hope here and trying to be patient.\nIs her decision more-so based on her PM? I believe so, her mother believes so, a few mutual friends believe so. But in her current state how do I know? She isn't talking to me anymore or her mom or anyone to my knowledge about what she is dealing with (other than her OBGYN).\n\nI believe she went on HRT, and I have seen a little improvement and so think she feels improvement on a few symptoms based on just a few comments she has said, but I don't think it has fully kicked in. Would she potentially snap out of it and be able to talk to me again?\n\nAlso pertinent she went from a nurturing, loving mother to suddenly completely ignoring our children or just has enough energy or tolerance to be around them in small doses. I am doing essentially everything for our kids. She is now selfish and self centered and isolating herself most of the time in our master bedroom. She needs me to remind her of appointments or the extra curricular stuff for our kids. I feel this is part of her PM.\nI just want to understand. I am trying to be patient. But I just don't know what to do. When I try to talk to her she cannot speak and cannot explain her feelings with any true self reflection.\n\nAny information, clarity, experience, advice for me, would be greatly appreciated.\n\n I cannot begin to understand the changes women have dealt with, but l am trying  for the love of my wife and family and to salvage my marriage if possible.\nThanks in advance.",
    "Estrogen is the emotional hormone, when that runs low they stop caring about anything. Progesterone is needed to protect against uterine cancer and bone loss, but can make them moody or angry. It helps with sleep which she is probably struggling with, and that makes everything worse. Testosterone helps with libido. \n\nThe HRT isn't a magic bullet for everyone and needs tuning. Too much and they cry at all the abused animal charity commercials, too little and they want divorces and say a lot of really mean things. You have to grow a thick skin and survive it. \n\nWe are on year 3 or 4 (hard to measure) and it feels like things are levelling out. They also need experience to learn how to manage their new hormones. It's like when a man goes through puberty and acts unstable for a bit til he learns how to control the testosterone.",
    "Hopefully the HRT does help her moods and ability to talk with you. Everyone responds to it differently so it’s hard to give specifics but I know both estrogen patch and progesterone pill helped me feel sane and lowered my rage. I know I’ve had thoughts of walking away or “burning all down” so I wouldn’t have to deal. \n\nYour post makes you sound caring and compassionate so that’s all you can really do - try to support (listen) and give her grace while she figures out what works. Tell her you know she’s having a hard time and you’ll be there for her. Which it sounds like you’re doing already. Are either of you in therapy? That might help work through the feelings.",
    "I understand PM mood swings as being upset with yourself, because estrogen levels provide a desire for connection with other people. Less estrogen less stability in desire for connection, then those feelings of shame and overwhelm because it doesn't seem like you can meet family or societal norms due to a lack of patience and forgiveness toward herself. Your support is admirable, but still may not be providing a safe emotional space for her because men always learn this later in life than women. The physical changes are so challenging that she may be checking out for two weeks at a time because it's messy and irregular. Like knowing your body so well up to this point and now you can't trust yourself to be able to walk down the street because the dam could burst unexpectedly and you can't be prepared in all situations for what could happen. Me 45 M, her 45 F, and we are at the very beginning of PM changes with no HRT.",
    "I'm 54 and in 6 years my bubbly, confident, sexy wife has become a lovely, sweet, little old lady. That I still love dearly. It's a rough ride but your wife is changing and the person she was isn't coming back. Hope you both make it through and still have a good, if different, relationship at the end of it.\n\nGood luck!",
    "Don’t ask on the perimenopause sub..they all tell the women to leave..without any knowledge of situation or relationship!  The main advice I can share is let alot of the names/horrid moments wash over you.. I was in the military so being shouted at is easy to ignore lol\n\nSecondly, take a look at you….could you be doing more in the relationship? Are you pulling your weight…sometimes we need to pull theirs as well in a relationship ..we cover each other when needed. \n\nThirdly..and most importantly if she is in denial on things, going on about it won’t help, you just need to pick your battles and let her see herself\n\nIt’s not easy for either of you..but working together helps",
    "Peri woman here - it can take months for the body to settle in with HRT, I’m 7 months in and have taken steps backwards where initially it seemed like an immediate positive change for me, and I’m now trying a different method. It’s sadly not a quick fix, for anyone. I wish you all the best",
    "I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. As a woman, it really baffles me why some women dig in their heels around this and seem to not really care about how their behavior is impacting others. It’s selfish and short sighted. I honestly can’t emphasize unless they have a medical reason that prevents them from addressing through hormone therapy.\nDo you think the negative impact this may be having on your children would help her be more self aware?",
    "M49 and supporting my wife as she transitions. \n\nThere’s MP and then there’s mental issues.\n\nReading the comments, I can’t quite grasp the borderline victim blaming (not giving her a safe space? What is she, 5 yrs old?) or that such level of abject abuse somehow deserves an excuse (eg just a bad case of hormones pal, tough). \n\nYou seem to be doing everything you can - and then some. I’ve got friends who have left their wife’s for far lesser symptoms. I don’t endorse them or their actions - you are one of a kind, a thoughful man and an inspiration - but this is your life too. Look after your kids. Look after yourself. They and you are hurting. This will create scars for life.",
    "Sounds like you doing a great job understanding. Tolerating is a different matter. Catch me on a bad day and I’ll be honest with you, I really have a hard time coping. I miss my old partner, she’s gone, but left her body behind. My safe emotional space has also departed. HRT isn’t a magic bullet and needs fine tuning, I’m sure most doctors are woefully inexperienced with what this means. All is not lost though we have great memories and some comfort can be had remembering the good times. Photographs of our younger days are always good to look at.",
    "Same same almost to the letter. I’m riding the same wave mate but all I can offer is solidarity. Crazy part life.",
    "I am 53F in perimenopause which surfaced afib. I don't get hardly any symptoms and what I do is very mild and actually increased libido. I have no desire to distance myself, even share updates via email with friends about it. Sorry you got a wife with deeper issues. There may be a midlife crisis going on, perhaps seeing a psychologist will help. Good luck.",

    "Copied and pasted from today's NYT;\n\n\nDemand for the hormone is surging, and not just to treat libido. Here’s what we know about its benefits, and potential risks.\n\n\nListen to this article · 8:08 min Learn more\nAn illustration of a woman holding a bottle of gel while looking at a vase of droopy leaves with one white lily, alive and well. \nCredit...Maria Hergueta\nBy Danielle Friedman\nPublished Feb. 4, 2025\nUpdated Feb. 6, 2025\nLeer en español\nSign up for the Well newsletter, for Times subscribers only.  Essential news and guidance to live your healthiest life. Get it in your inbox.\nFive years ago, when Dr. Risa Kagan offered testosterone to postmenopausal women whose sex drive had vanished, the Berkeley-based OB-GYN had few takers. Women were wary of using what they thought was a male sex hormone, she said, and concerned about developing “masculine” traits, like body hair or a deeper voice.\n\nNow, she said, “every patient is coming in asking.”\n\nAcross the country, women’s health providers have reported a similar surge in recent months, sparked by menopause influencers on Instagram and TikTok who promote testosterone’s wellness benefits. Even Kate Winslet praised its power to make her “feel sexy again.”\n\nBut amid the cultural enthusiasm for testosterone — and a newly energized conversation about helping women feel good through the menopause transition and beyond — nuances about the drug are getting lost, experts told The Times. While decades of evidence suggests that low doses of testosterone can increase some women’s sexual desire with few side effects, some proponents are overstating the drug’s ability to boost mood, cognition, muscle strength and heart health, they said, and underplaying its potential risks.\n\n“People are trying to take testosterone for everything — it’s become the new feel-good drug,” said Dr. Kagan, who is a clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and has prescribed and studied testosterone in women for more than 20 years. But for anything beyond libido, “if you really delve into the data, it’s just not ready for prime time.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo what do we actually know about testosterone and women? Here’s what the scientific evidence has revealed about its very real benefits, and its risks.\n\nWhy do women need testosterone?\nThere’s a lot we know about testosterone’s role in women’s bodies, and more we don’t know.\n\nWhile men have about 10 times as much testosterone as women, the hormone plays an important role in reproductive health for both sexes, said Dr. Susan Davis, an endocrinologist at Monash University in Australia, and one of the world’s leading researchers on women and sex hormones. In women, it is primarily produced by the ovaries and adrenal glands, and helps produce an egg each menstrual cycle, among other things.\n\nBeyond reproduction, though, researchers are still trying to figure out how testosterone affects women’s health. They are intrigued by the fact that women have testosterone receptors all over the body — including the heart, brain, muscles and bones — which suggests that it is linked to the health of these organs, Dr. Davis said, but we aren’t sure yet why or how.\n\nGenerally, women’s testosterone levels peak in their 20s, then gradually decline over time. They appear to rise again in their 70s, according to Dr. Davis’s research, so “there may be some survival benefit for older women,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor some women, as their testosterone declines, their libido declines, too. But this is far from true for everyone, Dr. Davis said. Women can have testosterone levels close to zero and have a raging sex drive, while others can have normal-to-high levels and struggle with a complete lack of desire.\n\nFor this reason, testing a woman’s testosterone levels without knowing how they might have changed over time doesn’t reveal much about her sexual or overall health, experts said, unless her numbers are atypically high, which could signal a condition like polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nHow can taking testosterone improve your health?\nFor some postmenopausal women diagnosed with low sexual desire, taking a low dose of testosterone can improve libido, including arousal, orgasm and the frequency of what researchers call “satisfying sexual events.”\n\nIt improves sexual health in about 50 percent of women who try it, but it’s not like “whammo bammo,” Dr. Kagan said — the effects are usually subtle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is partly because women’s sexual function is complex, and libido can be affected by many factors: aches and pains, depression and your relationship with your sexual partner, among other things, said Dr. Lauren Streicher, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University, who specializes in women’s sexual health.\n\nFor this reason, many women benefit most from taking testosterone along with seeing a sex therapist. For some of Dr. Streicher’s patients, “testosterone kind of gave them a little kick start — you know, it kind of woke up that part of the brain,” she said. But therapy led to more lasting improvements in their sex lives.\n\nMany women say testosterone has improved their energy, mood, mental sharpness and muscle strength — along with intangible benefits like making them say they “feel like themselves again” or “see the world in technicolor” — Dr. Streicher said. But research into the connection between safe doses of testosterone and these benefits is still inconclusive. In several studies, women who unknowingly received a placebo reported the same mood and health benefits as women taking testosterone.\n\n“I can’t argue with how people feel,” Dr. Streicher said. But, for now, “the data does not support that it is going to increase your general sense of well-being.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven in studies that have demonstrated testosterone’s positive impact on libido, the effect in the placebo group is also very high, experts said, which could reflect women’s response to finally feeling heard and validated after years of suffering.\n\nHow do you take testosterone?\nThe safest way to take testosterone for sexual desire is as a gel that you rub on the back of your calf, or on your thigh, according to major medical societies.\n\nBut women face obstacles accessing the drug, since the Food and Drug Administration has never approved testosterone for women — despite approving 31 different testosterone products for men. (The F.D.A. has yet to approve any drug to treat sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women; it has, however, approved two drugs, Addyi and Vyleesi, to treat it in premenopausal women.)\n\nAs a result, women’s options are limited. You can use a gel that’s formulated for men, giving yourself a tenth of the male daily dose by using your best judgment to ration a single tube over 10 days. You can get a dose formulated for women from a compounding pharmacy — but the concentration of compounded products is often less consistent. Or you can try to import a women’s testosterone cream from Australia, the only country that has approved the drug for women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\nNone of these options, which cost $10 or more per month, are covered by insurance.\n\nWhat are the risks?\nWhen taken at doses that raise your testosterone levels no higher than what’s typically seen in premenopausal women, side effects are rare, said Dr. James Simon, a menopause and sexual medicine specialist in Washington D.C. and clinical professor at The George Washington University School of Medicine. Your health care provider will likely want to test your levels a few weeks after starting the drug to make sure they’re not getting too high.\n\nIf your testosterone levels are too high for too long, however, you may experience side effects — some reversible, some not. These can include thinning of hair on your head, growth of hair on your face and chest, a deepening of your voice, acne, an enlarged clitoris, irritability and aggression.\n\nHigh testosterone levels can also lead to a thickening of the uterine lining and vaginal bleeding, and increase your risk for endometrial cancer, since the body converts excess testosterone into estrogen.\n\nSteer clear of pellets\nFor all of these reasons, experts discourage patients from receiving testosterone through “pellets,” or compounded hormone capsules inserted under the skin at medical spas, anti-aging clinics and medical offices. They typically contain much higher doses than gels.\n\nWhile the treatment can make women feel great in the short term, it can also cause testosterone levels to skyrocket — and once pellets are inserted, they can’t be removed. Patients have to wait out their side effects, or in some cases, live with them permanently.\n\nA correction was made on Feb. 4, 2025: An earlier version of this story misrepresented the Australian testosterone product for women.

    "Thank you!",
    "A lot of us peri women want testosterone!!  In the uk it’s very hit and miss whether we’re prescribed it, it’s down to our individual GP or if we’re lucky to get sat in front of a menopause specialist.  The thing is, is that testosterone isn’t trialed on women, so a fair few GPs don’t like to prescribe it. I’ve heard great feedback for how it positively affects peri women, I for one would love to try it",
    "I'm looking for advice on how to set/hold boundaries about behavior when the Rage is happening.\n\nI came home yesterday from taking a kid to his sport and my wife who had just gotten home from work was yelling and swearing at the other two kids.\n\nEg. \"You lazy fucking bitch\" - to our 13yr old daughter. \"Fucking useless prick\" - to our 8yr old son.\n\nI don't know how long it had been happening, but it lasted about 10 mins after I got home.\n\nFor context I never swear in front of my kids, she does sometimes - but milder words and she's never before sworn at the kids. The crime was that no one had emptied the dishwasher after school.\n\nThe reality is that peri has caused luteal phase PMDD and she had had a tough day at work.\n\nThe behavior is unacceptable for both of us and I don't want it to happen again.\n\nAny advice on how/when to talk to her about this?  What should I say? How do I explain this behavior to the kids?\n\nWhen she is like this I'd like her to remove herself from the situation - just to go and cool off somewhere. Next time it happens I will take the kids out of the house for a while.\n",
    "I am sorry you're going through this, but I have to say it's your wife who should remove herself from the situation and it's up to you to say so to protect your kids. \n\nI don't care how people think, but a person's actions are within their control. I grew up in a violent household and I used to make excuses for my parents, where and how they grew up etc, but ultimately they still had autonomy on how they acted.\n\nMenopause may be a reason for something, but it's not an excuse. Your partner, with your help, needs to recognise what's going on (perhaps as someone has mentioned with a safe word or even something more direct) and remove themselves from the situation. \n\nIf it was just you then maybe you choose to roll with the punches, maybe you don't, but with kids it's different. It doesn't matter what you tell them, all they'll remember is their mother swearing at them. They'll grow up resenting her.",
    "Only an ides but could you have a ‘safe word’ you can say when you think she’s getting unreasonable? Would she be open to that? I mean - does she know what she’s doing at the time or in hindsight?",
    "Record her and then play it back to her after she has calmed down.",
    "Good dad! \n\nI remember from my own mother going through menopause, though in a different way, and it had life long effects on me and my siblings. Unfortunately my dad was always a dick and never stepped up as a father or husband at any point during our lives. \n\nSo yes, nip it in the bud - make plans while she’s not raging, get her to a meno-trained doctor for HRT, deal with underlying relationship stuff - but most importantly, have a chat to your kids and explain menopause (in a respectful way) so they know it’s not them. \n\nReverse puberty can be a good way of contextualising it if they’ve been taught about their own hormonal changes. Explain there’s an adjustment phase but you guys are working on it together and it’s temporary.",
    "If I ever heard those kinds of words towards my daughter, I would pull my wife aside and calmly but firmly say, \"don't you ever do that again. I understand you're going through changes, and I understand you had a bad day, but that was completely unacceptable.\"\n\nSome of you guys have become so passive and compliant over the years that you're letting your wife walk all over you. Nip that shit in the bud. There is no excuse for this.",
    "Your wife is emotionally abusing your kids.\n\nAnd I think it’s not possible that it’s the first time, for someone who could speak or even think these words directed at their child.\n\nMy own perimenopausal rage has reached humiliating levels I’d never imagine possible. But even in the midst of the most epic, out-of-control unhinged meltdown, people retain their values and sense of right and wrong.\n\nHormones don’t have the ability to spontaneously generate hateful vitriol out of nowhere. They can’t trigger a transformation into a completely different person.\n\nIn my experience - and of course I could be wrong, but I think within most people’s experiences of this - the thoughts and emotions trigger an intense hatred towards *ourselves*.\n\nYou need to take action to protect your children first. Professional help for the wife second.",
    "I would divorce over this. No daughter should be called a bitch",
    "Make plans for the kids to be gone this weekend and talk to her once they're gone, or make plans for you and the kids to be gone somewhere together for the weekend and talk to her once you guys are packed and the kids are at a friend or neighbors or family members house; but ready to have space and a weekends with of space is probably perfect.\n\nSo make this happen tomorrow. \n\nI'm not sure what to say to her or how to say it to her; but I do understand how she feels because there are times I want to do the same with my own kids; but I don't and thats the difference. She has lost control. Thats the problem. \n\nHopefully someone can help you with the words; but definitely be prepared to give her space after whatever conversation you may have.\n\nGood luck",
    "I mean long-term, not day to day. DW (52) and I have been together almost 30 years, and always had a pretty touch-intensive relationship, in the sense we would take comfort from being physically close. (I'm setting the question of sex aside completely for now.)  This has been a slow but inexorable one-way ratchet for 5 years or so, but it's really hitting home now.\n\nPeri was tough, but I think we're through that now and into full-on menopause. With that has come a really obvious aversion to touching or being touched by me. Casual hugs, snuggling, or simple affectionate gestures in passing - gone. She has actually physically pushed me away a few times recently, which is really hard not to take personally.   \n\nThing is, I'd understand this better if it seemed like she'd actually come to dislike me. But I don't get that at all. Aside from seeming generally stressed out (this has been a fairly stressful period for our family), she doesn't act like our relationship has changed. No suggestion we sleep in separate rooms, no suggestions separation/divorce, no bitter fights.  We tend to seethe quietly rather than fighting anyway, but I can tell when she's pissed at me, and I don't think that's it. \n\nI want to give her the space she needs and not make her feel obligated to give me physical affection. At the same time, I need to feel wanted, not just like another body to handle household tasks, and I feel like our relationship is just withering away.  Maybe I just need a dog or something. \n\nAnyway. Suggestions and thoughts welcome, but mostly I just needed to vent. \n\nTL/DR - my wife doesn't want to touch me with a 10 foot pole and I'm feeling sorry for myself and being a whiny bitch about it. \n",
    "Have you asked her for some?  I've had a few times now where I've simply said \"we don't have to do anything, I just really need you to hold me\", and it usually works to some degree, at least until she gets too warm.  No guarantee it'll work for your situation, but worth trying.",
    "I could copy/paste this post and it would describe my current situation almost exactly, with the exception of sleeping in the same bed. I’ve been in the guest room for months now, (she’s always been a light sleeper, but now, if I so much as roll over it wakes her up.)\n\nI know I just need to suck it up and cope. Put her first, and let her know I’m here if needed, but the lack of intimacy is a major blow and difficult to handle. \n\nI’m sorry I don’t have a suggestion. I wish I did. At least we can commiserate together.",
    "I feel for you! My wife is in Peri right now and doesn’t offer me any meaningful affection at all anymore.  It’s kills your self worth for sure. \n\nIs she on HRT?  Estrogen from what I have read will do wonders for this and give her back the need for connection with you.  \n\nI have to say stewing in quiet about this is not a healthy way to dealing with it. Resentment only builds. Talk to her about it, tell her how you are feeling.  Use “I” statements instead of “you”.  Then tell her what you need.",
    "Let me know when you find an answer PLEASE.  DW 48 peri is starting to head that way with regards to sex.. i understand that she is going through a MAJOR fkn change in her life and I will be there 1,000% for her through thick and thin. I am a highly sexual person and we used to have sex daily if not every other day and now we're slipping to like 1 to 2 x's a week. She is bothered by me handling things by myself and honestly I'm just way to horny every day. \nI CAN'T STAND the thought of her making love outta obligation or some shit like that, the thought of that disgust me, so I don't talk about this with her because I feel if I do I'll end up with obligatory sex, and no one, no one is obligated to have sex with someone regardless of the relationship. \n\nAre we all just \"fkd\", excuse the pun.",
    "Sorry to hear what you are experiencing.\n\nI've got no idea on how to handle it, but physical affection is really important for me too.\n\nSo I feel for you!",
    "You aren't being a whiny bitch about it. This isn't how people deserve to live. You need to have the conversation about how this is unacceptable and that you won't continue to live like this.",
    "Are you talking about touch or sex?\n\nSex i can't help you with; but if its just needing touch then you may want to try something like massage.\n\nMy husband loves touching my body; but sometimes I'm not into anything sexual so he will offer me a massage instead. He gets one of my favorite lotions and gives me a full body massage without sexual touching or obligations for sex afterwards.\n\nThat allows him to see my body and feel it without it being anything more then that.\n\nAfter he's done massaging me he will tuck me in with a blanket and ask if we can snuggle. I usually say yes (99% of the time) and we just lay there in bed watching a movie until we fall sleep.\n\nAnother thing he likes to do is massage my feet if full body massages aren't on the menu for some reason so we do that.\n\nHe also loves to stroke my hair so sometimes he'll just say \"give me your head\" with a pillow on his lap and I know I'm gonna lay there and probably fall asleep while he runs his fingers through my hair and rubs my head.\n\nThos little acts of non sexual touching *can* lead to further intimacy (initiated by us wives) as they allow for love and calm to come, and a rebuilding of a non sexual intimacy between us; but you do need to keep sex off the table completely and let that desire build organically if it will- it may not and thats valid; but it might.\n\nI hope this helps ⚘",
    "Has she taken any HRT? Either during peri or now she’s come through the other side?

Now we’re back to being lovely and tactile and I’m also up for more",

    "I've only just found this sub as my wife's peri is well underway. I've read through the last year's worth of posts over the weekend.\n\nI wouldn't say \"feminism\" is the problem. The problem is that this is not a safe space for men to help each other with the issues men face during menopause.\n\nIt seems the majority of comments are from women, some great, some attacking. But the truth is, when men want a woman's perspective they can go to the menopause or perimenopause subs. Or they can talk to their partner.\n\nMany men need to drop their mask to really express feelings, and to hear unmasked advice of other men to  help us to cope/heal/improve ourselves.\n\nIt's hard to do that when you know the first 3 replies are going to be the opinions of your wife, mother and sister. No wonder there is so little engagement on this sub.\n\nValid opinions, sure. But I don't think the women that feel compelled to comment here realize that they are hindering the men from growing in the way they need to to be the partners they want to be.\n\nSo to the women reading this, please leave this space safe by not commenting. It's far better that your man does his unhinged vent into the Internet ether than with his friends in real life. Other Internet men will correct him more swiftly than his friends, and more effectively than a woman can. And when he does it in real life, those men will tell their wives - who are probably also your friends.",
    "A sub like this is inevitably going to be feminist, and it should be– a pretty basic premise of any discussion of menopause has to be that women are people, and their emotional lives matter just as much as men's.  There really can't be compromise on that, and we really don't want this to be a place for people trying to PUA their wives.\n\nBut a sub like this also has to treat men's emotional lives as important!  If any thread about \"I want to have sex with my wife\" is deleted, then the mods are declaring that this is not a place where men can talk about something that matters to them, no matter what the tone.  And then the sub will– and should!– die, because it's of no use.\n\nThe trick is how to maintain a feminist, respectful space that still honors men's needs and desires.  And doing that is going to require more nuance than looking for blame.",

    "Had a come to Jesus discussion with my wife  (48F) regarding her hormonal mood swings, vaginal changes, loss of libido and how every emotional outburst is directed at me (she admits this).  I brought up that maybe it’s time to talk about HRT. I’m 49M and have already started with TRT and I’m feeling great!  \n\nShe proceeded to tell me that she doesn’t want to take anything that alters the natural aging process.  I told her the decision is hers and I’m not pressuring her.\n\nAlthough, I can’t wrap my head around not taking steps to stop vaginal atrophy, dryness, painful periods, hot flashes, mood swings.  I certainly can’t fathom a world where I wouldn’t fix my libido if I could.  \n\nShe then asks me if I’m scared about what will happen.  I told her yes, I’m terrified because I don’t think I could live in a sexless marriage or a marriage where she is having chore sex. We currently make love 5-6 days per week, but I can feel her desire starting to slip.  She did say she knows if it gets too bad that I will just leave.  We’ve been together for 27 years.  \n\nThat’s it…just needed to vent.  We ended it by saying we’d figure it out over the next few years.",

She’s terrified of what’s happening to her body, her mind, and her sense of self. Those aren’t equal fears.\n\n\nHRT isn’t just about keeping desire intact—it’s about protecting brain function, bone density, and long-term health. If she chooses it, it should be because she feels it improves her quality of life, not just to keep things the same for you.\n\n\nInstead of focusing on what’s slipping away for you, try asking her what she’s afraid of, what she’s struggling with, what she needs to feel supported. \n\n\nIf she already believes you might leave her over this, that should be a wake-up call.

    "As much as your wife is entitled to here bodily autonomy, I hate the \"natural\" discourse as it is deeply flawed thinking that impacts negatively the health of many people, and not just menopausal women so here are some talking points for you.\n\nEarthquakes are natural, yet we build reathquake-resistant structures. Scurvy is natural, yet we check our vitamin intake. Bear maulings are natural, yet we carry pepper spray on the trail. Pregnancy and childbirth is natural, yet women are followed by a doctor and ceasarians save lives. \n\nIf your wife had severe debilitating anemia despite eating well, would she accept iron supplementation? That would be replacing a natural thing her body needs... same with HRT. There is even *bioidentical* HRT!\n\nThe bad sleep associated with menopause accelerates Alzheimer. UTIs associated with uro-genital atrophia are one of the main killers of women of a certain age. I could go on!\n\nI recommend that you both read ***The Menopause Manifesto*** by Dr. Jen Gunter. Unlike other authors in the area, she is laying out the all the facts in a non-pressuring way, respecting the agency of women in the decision process. The science is sound and the read is actually fun!\n\nAnd may I suggest perhaps the help of a couples therapist to mediate those discussions so she doesn't feel pressured by you. Aging comes with greiving no matter what our medical decisions are and we do not have the same rythm in assimilating changes. \n\nGood luck to both of you!",
    "I understand her perspective of wanting to age naturally. Many of us ascribe to that philosophy. \n\nI guess there’s nothing really natural about how we live or age these days. \n\nIf technology exists, and it’s helpful, we use it, right? If a medication or treatment can actually lessen suffering as we age, what is wrong with considering it? \n\nIs it natural to age? Yes, if we can. Is it natural enough to become frail, yes, fairly common. Is it natural to have joint pains? Is it natural and even normal, for peri and post menopause women, to have disrupted and non-restful sleep? Yea. Natural and very common. \n\nIs it natural to have itchy, burning, uncomfortable sensations in the vaginal, bladder area? Yea. It’s natural. It’s also very natural to have repeated urine infections and even scarring over the clitoris. It’s all natural. And none of this has to do with having sex. It’s just natural and fairly common for these changes to occur. \n\nIt’s also fairly normal, common, and natural for middle aged women to lose words. And vocabulary. And unable to name the thing on the tip of their tongues. Quite amusing when it happens on a public forum. \n\nNow. There are group of women, small minority of women, who transition without much, or seemingly bothersome symptoms. God bless them. And maybe your wife is thinking she is one of them. But from your description, she is suffering. \n\nI also know that I could have bought into “naturalist” belief of aging. \n\nI had many protective mechanisms to allow for numerous changes. It wasn’t until I could hardly move without pain that I realized I needed to change my life. Not just pain. Mental and physical fatigue. Withdrawing.  \n\nI knew this wasn’t normal. And it wasn’t because I was depressed. Although it certainly “fit” many medical model of a middle-aged woman with depression and anxiety. \n\nI knew that it wasn’t normal to me. \n\nThat’s when I found r/menopause subreddit and it changed my life. I got informed. I got informed about what’s going on with the changes. The symptoms. The trajectory of what could come. Then I read books. Then numerous podcasts. \n\nAfter two months of getting informed about HRT, I was scared but ready. \n\nI’ve been on HRT for 6 months. While it didn’t correct everything, it made it possible for me to move again. Get out of bed. Get out into the world again. \n\nAnd it stopped chafing at my lady bits. And I can entertain thoughts of fun, living, and loving. \n\nGood luck to you and your wife.",

    "It’s not preventing or altering the natural aging process - it’s very similar to taking a multivitamin, you’re just replacing/topping up what your body isn’t making as much of anymore. It’s not putting anything alien into your body at all. And it helps with things you wouldn’t realise, like eyesight/floaters improving, hair feeling nicer, etc (from a peri woman)",
    "A couple of thoughts.  \n\nHas she consulted with the gyno?  She can still be a no for HRT but it never hurts to get the information.\n\nNow I am speaking from personal experience now not medical.  HRT helped me thru the worst of menopause and you eventually get off of HRT.  I did not change the natural progression it just helped me get through the worst symptoms.\n\nAs a man and husband it will be hard to get her to do something but you can encourage to check with the gyno.  And get all her options.  Let her know you will support whatever choice she makes but would she please get all the info 1st?   That's me making stuff up.  You know how to talk to your wife.\n\nHRT is much gentler on the body than it use to be and sometimes a small amount will make a huge difference.\n\nGiving up sugar and alcohol also helped. As well as I increasing and prioritizing protein consumption 1st at every meal.\n\nGood luck to you both. It's not an easy transition time for either of you and she will walk out the other side in her own way.",
    "I’m talking with my wife about this too. It’s hard. I feel your pain brother.",
    "I think the best way to get your wife on board with HRT would be attacking the \"natural process\" from a position where she can understand and agree that what happens \"naturally\" isn't always what's best.\n\n**ie.**\n\n- Diabetics and insulin \n\n- cancer and chemotherapy \n\n- headache and medication for it\n\n- vitamins and other supplements to support better health (they're as synthetic as HRT and used to fortify the body the same way)\n\n- etc..\n\nMedications are used all time to treat different conditions and improve quality of life so why is HRT so different as compared to any of that?\n\nYou can also pick apart other things she uses or does which deviates away from anything \"natural\" \n\nDoes she wear makeup? That's not natural.\n\nDoes she color her hair? Thats not natural. \n\nDoes she shampoo her hair, use hairspray and other products? None of that is natural. \n\nLaundry detergent, body washes, diah soaps, chemical cleaners for the house- none of that is natural; but she embraces it because it helps to keep herself, her home and everything in it clean which in turn keeps herself and loved ones free from dirt and bacteria that could cause illness and upset quality of life. \n\nThere is so much we do and have today which isn't natural. Refrigeration, vehicles, TV, the internet, synthetic fabrics for clothing- plastic FFS! 🤦‍♀️\n\nIf she is hell bent on \"natural\" then picking apart natural is how you're going to affect any change if change is indeed possible. \n\nI doubt wifey is out there beating clothes on rocks with soap berries or soaking clothes in old urine to clean them like they did in ancient times. She's making use of all the modern things which make her life better each and every day, and HRT is just one more of those many modern wonders that do the same in this context. \n\nYou can also talk to her about HRT helping to lesson changes of things like bone loss, heart attack, dementia, etc... and if she comes at you with \"cancer risks\" remind her that smoking, alcohol, red meats, deodorants, makeup products, talcum powder, bacon and milk have all been linked as causes of cancer so if she's doing any of that stuff she's already assuming the risk of such while enjoying her life which is the whole point- life is ro be enjoyed and quality of life is imperative for everyone.\n\nLastly, tell her she doesn't get a prize or trophy for going through the \"naturally\" just like there's no prize or trophy for giving birth without pain relief, or having dental work done without freezing, or surgery without anesthesia. \n\nShe doesn't have to rough it out, and why she's choosing to do so is the block you need to help her move beyond.\n\nSomething in her brain is telling HRT is bad and suffering is better. She's wrong. You just have to use parallels that aren't the block itself to help her reize she is wrong.\n\nI hope this helps ⚘",
    "I'll try not to make this too long a post !!\n\nMy wife has been going through a huge change for the last 8 years or so, she's on a couple of the tablets for Menopause although she's not sure if it is or not, but she suffers all the symptoms you read about.\nShe has completely lost her libido and I was aware and understood that so we stopped having sex obviously.  She has now also said that she doesn't fancy me and doesn't want to kiss or cuddle with me .. but says that she still loves me. \n\nAs a man we tend to think automatically that our wives must fancy someone else or be having an affair because we have no idea what changes happen to a woman during the menopause, and that if they stop fancying us they must be cheating!!\n\nI do not think this and am trying very hard to support her and be there for her, she is the love of my life and I love her with a passion ❤️ \nWe've been together for 15 years, 6 of which married.\nI want to be there with/for her through all of this and pray we come out the other side and she still wants to be with me.  I have read lots about the peri menopause and menopause and tried to educate myself as well as understand  how she may be feeling with all the hormonal changes going on right now.\n\nI would love some advice from anyone who's been through this and the do's and don'ts of what I should or could be doing to help her. \nCurrently, when I'm with my wife, I'm just trying to read the room and be here for her, she's told me that she processes things on her own to try and work stuff out so when she's quiet to leave her to her thoughts, so I do.  I find it so painful seeing her go through all this as well as the selfish thoughts about me, our relationship and how ugly I must be for her not to at least fancy me! But I'm trying hard to ignore the selfish thoughts about me and to focus on my wife, be there for her and help her get through this.\nI make sure she knows I love her and tell her regularly how much I love her deeply and that I will be here always, and I mean it. I want to spend the rest of my life with my amazing, gorgeous wife despite being terrified she'll leave me as her feelings for me have changed currently.\n\nWhat can I do to be there for her?\n\nAny help/advice greatly received, thank you ",
    "First, tell your wife (and you too) to take a look at r/Menopause.\nThen, my wife gets better when she begans with HRT.\nAnd a lot of patience. \nSex life is inexistent in my case, but I know its not her fault (and remember it when you feel angry about it)",
    "Is she on HRT or has she thought about it or discussed with doctor? If not, that should be first step. Find someone who is knowledgeable about women’s health &amp; hormones. Getting on HRT is a life changer and marriage saver! And thank you for being understanding &amp; supportive towards her while she works through it. Peri/Menopause is a BEAST!",
    "Your approach so far sounds reasonable to me.\n\nSomething you haven't mentioned is your domestic life.  Do you already share in housework?  Is there more you can do to lighten her load?  I've found that anything I can do to relieve stress or prevent it in the first place is greatly appreciated.  For me this has included things like picking our daughter up from school more often, expanding what parts of the house I clean, and vacuuming more frequently.  It's all little things throughout the day/week.  Of course, phrasing and intent are critical, because you don't want things to be taken the wrong way (I'm only trying to help you out; I mean no disrespect or criticism of how you normally do these tasks.  that sort of thing).\n\nBeyond that it's highly dependent on your wife, yourself, and your relationship.  Take what follows with a grain of salt, because YMMV.\n\nI've found that offering solutions is a no-no.  Often times my wife just wants me to listen, and putting a potential solution forward is seen as an attempt to interfere or, worse, control.  This is pretty hard for me because solving problems is what I do.  But.  For her I've stopped saying \"have you tried...\" or \"how about this...\" or \"what happens when...\" or \"do you want me to...\" unless or until she directly asks.  I think this is because it helps frame peri as a(n unpleasant) stage of her life, not explicitly as a problem.\n\nMaking sure she knows that I love her and find her attractive has helped a lot.  The changes she's going through have been messing with her self-image and causing a bit of dysmorphia.  So I've made sure to step up the romancing and remind her of how crazy I still am about her.  Lately she's been getting texted more pics of myself (in various states of undress because she thinks they're hot, but you do you!), and I check in on her day at work to see how she's feeling.  I'm spending more time massaging her back and feet and just generally being with her because she likes that.  I've been packing a little love note in her lunch every day.  Nothing major, just a post-it note with a few sentences about something I love about her and a single chocolate taped to it (I jokingly refer to this as \"the emergency chocolate\").  Sometimes it's about her looks, sometimes her personality, and sometimes just something random and sweet.  For example, Friday I compared her to Autumn, since that's her favorite season.\n\nThe biggest thing, however, was accepting that everything she's going through right now is outside of my ability to \"fix\".  There is literally nothing I can do which will let her feel or be \"normal\" again, even though that's what we both want.  I needed to stop trying to \"solve\" things despite every urge I felt (and still feel).  She needs to be the one making the decisions and figuring out how to proceed.  Letting her experience peri and work her own way through it and only offering direct assistance when she asks for it has been more helpful than anything else I've tried so far.\n\nAgain, not distancing or ignoring, just clearing room for her to process big things by knocking out the little stuff for her.\n\nFinally, and this may sound weird, you do need to take care of yourself, too.  It's great that you have this level of concern for your wife and want to help her out.  Don't let yourself fall to pieces in the process or you won't be able to be there when she needs/wants you to be.  Make sure you're still eating and sleeping well (because if she's like my wife, she's really *not* sleeping well right now) and that you're getting time to relax with your hobbies.",
    "I read this and it sounds exactly like my own situation to the point I could have written this. \n\nYou need to make sure you are looking after yourself and that is something in your control, try and make it as easy as possible for your wife which you appear already to be doing. It doesn’t last forever and you need to tell yourself it is just a phase and hopefully you can both come out stronger at the end.\n\nHRT doesn’t work for everyone by the way",
    "\\&gt;She has now also said that she doesn't fancy me and doesn't want to kiss or cuddle with me .. but says that she still loves me.\n\nShe doesn't love you. Sorry to say. She loves you like she might her brother or sister, but not as a husband. She wouldn't avoid a hug or kiss from her children because that would be unloving. She wouldn't avoid cuddling with a pet. She needs to be honest with you and with herself.",

    "Yes they wanted to give me AD but when I said hot flashes…",
    "I was laughed at by my gyno and she would only give me Effexor as an AD. I refused to use it as I had every symptom on the book EXCEPT hot flashes. I went on MIDI (which is covered by my insurance) an online telehealth clinic. I was given estrogen patch and progesterone pill immediately and I've been on it a month and there is a major improvement in most of my symptoms - except brain fog and literally no libido. I need testosterone for those, but my MIDI doc couldn't prescribe T in my state (SC) so I'm hoping I can get my PCP to do it when I see him at the end of January.  See if MIDI is covered by your insurance which you can do online for free, you just need to enter the group or member ID #. \\*Also be aware, my insurance company is making me pay HUGE copays on my bioidentical hormones $417/mo...I now use Good RX instead of insurance and I'm only paying $98/mo.

    "If she’s going to a traditional gyno doc, then get a consult with a holistic clinic that does bioidentical HRT creams. My wife is looking into it. After her gyn f-d up her hysterectomy and nearly killed her, he wouldn’t even give her HRT which would have been synthetic (that’s what gynecologists give).  Bullshit. Traditional medicine doesn’t give attention to menopause. Insurance companies don’t cover it. They don’t give a shit. I think the old docs and insurance execs don’t care. You would think they would get women the care they need  - don’t their own wives need help?  Maybe those guys are rich enough to get a young woman with benefits on the side and don’t care about their own wife. It’s funny how men have been getting Viagra for the past 25+ years, but women can’t even get hormone treatments covered by insurance. In some cases it is denied. That POS doc my wife went to suggested giving her anti-depressants and gabapentin. What the hell? She doesn’t need those drugs. Like I said, find alternative medicine but be ready to pay $$$.",
    "I can't answer your question, but If mood symptoms are the main/only symptoms, antidepressants have been shown to be effective. This doesn't mean they'll work for everyone, or an individual will have a better experience with this route vs. HRT, or the other way around, however it IS a valid treatment option that works for some people.",
    "I (58M) am 6 years deep in our menopause journey ( 5 years peri) having read through the available posts on this sub I can relate to all the perspectives. I have a brilliant partner who has suffered greatly with all the symptoms. I came here to say that I believed it feels a lot harder for modern men than it may have been for the older generations. We already share the housework, childcare and are expected to be engaging and good listeners. I'm fine with this.Then I came to the realisation that our elevated position in the menopause inclusion could be seen as an advantage? Being able to openly discuss the issues our partners are facing surely is of some comfort to them and therefore we aren't having as bad a time of it as our grandfather's did. Having said that I think we may be suffering from poor mental health as a result. Wouldn't it be good,  if at the same time our partners started HRT we were prescribed CBT.

    "I am posting this just to see if anybody has any thoughts on how I can deal with all this. Am I crazy?  Is this all normal?   She has literally changed the parameters of our relationship in the span of a few weeks and I am just left scrambling for something I can  grasp on too that feels familiar. Not handling this well, I have been very insecure about things. \n\nMy wife and I are 43 years old with 2 daughters ages 9&amp;5.  Been together for 17 years. She first started noticing Perimenopause symptoms about a year ago with a random frozen shoulder. Unknown at the time that low estrogen can affect joints like this. She rehabbed that shoulder for 4-5 months to get it functional again. About 6 months ago she really started noticing symptoms. She would spend her nights in our bedroom isolated reading her smutty romance novels, and watching her own TV shows. She became more withdrawn and disconnected from me, sex became more infrequent than it already was with young 2 kids in the house. Those smutty romance novels that actually sparked a renewal for us in the bedroom, she now admitted that they didn't really do the trick for her anymore. Her periods started becoming very irregular.  Moodswings, irritability, unable to handle the same stressors of daily life, GI issues, no libido, doesn't want to be hugged or touched that much any more, depression, fatigue, poor sleep. It all set in like week by week.    \n  \nPerimenopause has developed in to a full blown mid-life crisis for her, has told me she has had feelings of wanting to blow up her life, says that she is being pulled in every direction by her job, kids, our 2 puppies, and me and feels like she has no agency over her time. No time for herself. No hobbies or interests  that bring her joy. Nothing fills her cup. Her home is no longer a place of refuge for her. She is searching for herself.  Back in September, her Doctor put her on Progesterone and some supplements to help with stress and mood.  Hasn't helped that much. She has some good days followed by many many bad days. Won't see the doctor again until April. The doctor knew about the frozen shoulder but wanted to just try progesterone first for 6 months. I've asked her to reach out to the doctor for an estrogen patch or cream as well, as clearly she is struggling.  I don't want her to just languish in the status quo. But anytime I try to bring this stuff to light she just blows me off and gets defensive, tells me to quit pushing her,  says she has done her research and trusts the doctor.    \n  \nHer therapist, is helping her with her mental issues, telling her to go out with her friends more, find a hobby just for her, spend more time on self care, and to build a life outside her relationship with me and our kids.  I support all that, I truly do, I have never discouraged her in the past from hanging out with her girlfriends, and finding new interests. When she started reading midway through 2023, I was super supportive as it was something she was never really into in the past. She read over 100 books in 2024, but yet she says she doesn't have any hobbies? She is big into working out too. I encourage her to work out five days week, go for walks out in nature.  So by all means fill your cup.   \n  \nAs for myself.... this has been the hardest 6 months of my life. I feel like I've lost my wife. She used to be a very loving and affectionate woman, now she protests and says she not a \"lovey dovey\" person like me. (um hello you just aren't right now, like I would have never married you if you were this way by nature).  Sex life is pretty much non-existent now. I only get sexual favors here and there as a duty with no affection behind it, like she rather be doing anything else. Any sort of affection from her is minimum at best.  No more passionate kisses, no more warm embraces, no more just cuddling on the couch or in bed. If I ask for something I get a quip/eye roll before she reluctantly engages.  Even showing appreciation or gratitude for simple gestures is at a minimum.  I do the majority of the cooking in our house, barely any acknowledgement for how much work that takes to prepare a good meal every day for a family. We take on the housework pretty evenly, and I have stepped up even more just to take things off her mind, and it just doesn't matter.  I've talked to her about how I feel alone in our marriage, how treating me this way is damaging us. I've ask her if we can start being more intentional with how we treat each other, have more deep conversations to keep us emotionally connected. She tells me that she is just trying to get by day to day and has nothing left to give, and totally unreceptive to working on our marriage right now.   \n\nAll these things and some other hurtful events involving her interactions with a male co-worker have caused a great deal of insecurity inside of  me about our relationship. She tells me that she loves me and that she never had any questions about our relationship before, but my insecurity and they way I am handling everything has made her question us. She has said many times that if she has to work on us, then she can't work on herself, and this has made her resent me as she feels like I am taking from her.  The thing that just pisses me off and hurts me to core is that seemingly everyone else in her life is treated with respect and consideration. She shares what she is going through with her girl friends, her gay bestie, her mother. But she does not want to share with me. She acts engaged and pleasant with all her co-workers, she goes out of her way to help them.  I her husband and closest person in her life am not treated with any consideration, I take the brunt of everything.  Left wondering what is she thinking? Why and how can she treat me this way? ",
    "Regarding the progesterone only for six months, IMO, heck, no. Women have estrogen receptors in almost every tissue of their body (including shoulders and brains.) Without it, the body is learning a whole new way of functioning, without something it has had for decades.  \n\nUnless there is some reason she can't have estrogen, I have never heard of progesterone only for six months, but I am admittedly not a doctor. (I do have a research-oriented graduate degree, have done a lot of menopause reading/listening, and catch my own doctors in errors regularly.) Most doctors are not well educated on peri/menopause, and acknowledge that their training is minimal.\n\nPerhaps you and/or she can hop on to r/menopause and hear how the other women are doing if you all haven't already?  There is a wiki over there if you haven't seen it, with more information on hormones and risk.  Theoretically, she could do telehealth and have estrogen in a week or so.  It may be a magic pill, or may do nothing, it varies for everyone. \n\nIt is a crazy experience. She probably doesn't recognize herself. I know I don't recognize myself.\n\nBut the final thing is this: she will have to figure this out. You can't force her to. Hope you can hang in there.",
    "*Um, hello you just aren't right now. Like I would have never married you if you were like this.*\n\nMy dawg, fix this attitude with the quickness if any part of you actually wants to stay in this marriage.\n\nYou yourself have given us a litany of ways your wife feels like total dogshit. I don't personally like to fuck when I feel like garbage. I NEVER want to fuck the guy who makes a statement like that. You might never say it to her - but, I assure you that she's picked up on this and it's not going to go well for you. \n\nYou made vows of sickness and health, better or worse. This is sickness and worse. Put on your big boy pants and step it up as a partner, as a parent, as a person, as a penis having man (sorry, I needed to continue the alliteration). \n\nThis is a really bad time for US. Does it affect the whole household negatively? Yes. But we're the ones going through it 24/7. We don't get to take breaks. We're at the mercy of hormones for literally every aspect of our lives. It affects our appearance, our weight, our appetite, our patience levels, our heart health, mental health, sleeping, memory, GI, joints, bones.\n\nETA: Take sex off the table for the moment and jerk off like a fiend if you have to. Be helpful. Take some crap off of her plate. Draw her a bath. Give her a massage without the expectation of sex. That's how my husband got back in pants.",
    "She needs estrogen.\n\nEstrogen as you may know already is the hormone responsible for “connection” and when we hit this phase and it dips, we realize we’ve spent most of our lives, time, energy on everyone but ourselves. \n\nIf it helps, she probably doesn’t enjoy this either.",
    "Regarding the sex thing- I’m going thru this. Testerone cream is helping but has taken almost 3 months of use to get some sex drive back. The problem is the hormones but ALSO- the vagina itself begins to change. Sex for me does not feel like the sex before the change started. It feels like something strange- like a washboard bumping sensation. Not that full sensation I used to get. The ability to orgasm has also disappeared….. I struggled for close to 5 years before I finally saying enough and went to the gynecologist for estrogen cream to rub all over place down there. Right now estrogen cream and testosterone are keeping my sex life afloat.",

    "She needs a better dr.  Estrogen and a smidgen of testosterone are essential",
    "I'm posting just to keep up on any comments that get put here. \n\nThis scenario other than a few things like children's ages and the number of dogs is almost identical to my situation. My wife has identified she's perimedopasal but isn't on any type of hrt.  I really don't know how to broach the subject without her getting defensive/to tired/I don't want to talk about this now/let's talk about this later (and later, not being tired, not being defensive, never happens) and then it's a rinse and repeat cycle. \n\n&gt;She acts engaged and pleasant with all her co-workers, she goes out of her way to help them. I her husband and closest person in her life am not treated with any consideration, I take the brunt of everything. Left wondering what is she thinking? Why and how can she treat me this way?\n\nThat part really hits close to home for me. It's a real shitty feeling that I'm trying my best to know that it's only as real as I want to make it.",
    "She needs to be on estrogen too, not just progesterone. I question the \"menopause specialist\" if she thought testing was the way to assess her hormone levels, as that is widely known to be inaccurate due to wildly fluctuating hormones during peri.\n\nYou're lucky that she's open to HRT, many women seem to not be even if they are eligible. Your wife might try an online service like Midi to speak to physicians who actually are experts in this area. Then she can keep per doc if she's generally satisfied, but consult with more knowledgeable providers.\n\nEverything that you described is classic for this stage of life. Not everyone experiences it, but it's fairly common.  If she's on Reddit, she should read the Menopause sub, it's full of women who feel the same way she does, blew up their life, and have serious regrets.\n\nYou may be getting the brunt of it because 1, she does feel comfortable with you and doesn't need to mask and 2, frankly, you may generally be someone she does feel annoyed about. I went through that phase with my husband but it did pass. He was very patient and rode it out, and now everything is good.  If you still have open and honest communication, you can probably weather this storm. I know it seems awful and it's hard to feel singled out, but it may pass.\n\nBut a tip is to examine some of the things you are doing. Are there ways you could be more supportive, more helpful? A lot of men feel they're doing more than they actually are, because the bar is so low for men from a relationship and parenting perspective.\n\nIt's just my husband and I and we both have FT jobs, and life already seems exhausting. To have dogs and kids on top of that just seems totally excessive, draining and stressful. She's probably completely overwhelmed like any sane person would be.  And women do carry more of the emotional load most of the time, so it all seems like too much to her probably, and it is.  I'd look for ways to streamline your life if possible, although that may be hard to do given the choices you've made.",
    "Other than being married a bit longer and 2 adult kids... your thoughts pretty much mirror mine. Everyone says focus on yourself and pickup a new hobby, but when 25 yrs of your marriage was 100% dedicated to your wife, it feels impossible to switch gears. Been going on 2 years and it is completely life draining.",
    "Update:\nIt’s been about a month sense I posted my story on here.  Nothing has really changed. Still extremely withdrawn from me.  I am really struggling with how to proceed with my wife.  Every interaction with me is met with defensiveness.  She is completely checked out of our marriage aside from the day to day things that need to be done.  Says that she does not care to work on our marriage or relationship until she figures out what she wants out of life, or figures out how to be happy with the life she has made.  We’ve had many deep discussions about her life, our marriage, things that I want.  She simply doesn’t want to compromise on anything.  She shows no respect to my feelings or condition. \n\nOne particular issue that keeps coming up is the nature of her relationship with a male co-worker who she has become closer with over the last year.  He has cross boundaries with the type of content he has texted her.  It’s very obvious that he likes her and  is very in to her, and obviously flirts with her regardless if he is married.  She lied to me about the existence of these inappropriate texts and she did shut it down and the flirting was pretty much one-sided. I ask her to respect me as her husband and at the very least quit texting this man on personal device (she has agreed to this).  I understand that she still has to work with this individual, but he should not have access to her in this manner. She has told me that he is just a work friend and she has no intention of making it into anything more than that.  Just because he likes her is not something she can control, and that she is capable of handling that herself. I’ve asked her to please refrain from talking to this man about personal issues or confiding to him about her problems, and etc… those types of conversations lead to developing emotional intimacy and feelings and should be reserved for her spouse.  She has admitted that they do talk about things like raising kids and the hardships around it, work related issues about being unhappy at work.  She said she hasn’t talked to him about anything deeply personal or our marriage.  When the whole thing about the texting blew up many months ago she finally told me that she did have a conversation with him the next day they were both in the office and told him he can’t text her like that and that I had seen the texts and was livid.  I am a bit hurt by the fact that she never revealed to me that conversation even happened until many months after the fact. It would have eased my mind greatly. Instead it feels like she is hiding things.\n\nI’ve told her that I feel threatened by this friendship especially since she comes home and gives me a cold shoulder, all while talking to this guy at work about various things that she isn’t necessarily talking to me about. I do know they talk alot as he is constantly at the top of her chat list on the TEAMS.  I have not gone through and looked at the chats. I feel that would be a major violation, but I do have this feeling that she obviously enjoys the attention she gets From this guy.  I’ve asked her to please consider my feelings in terms of their interactions, would I be okay with the content of their conversations or interactions in the office?  She told me that she hasn’t done anything wrong and therefore doesn’t feel like she has to change the way she interacts with this male friend coworker regardless of how I feel.  My feelings simply don’t matter on this.  \n\nI feel like my requests are not over the top or controlling, I’ve not told her she can’t have male friends at work. I understand people who work together are going to be friends. I’ve just asked her to put some boundaries in place to help me feel more secure.  So that I am not going to be constantly wondering there is something else a foot.\n\nPart of me says to just let this go as it is driving a wedge into our relationship.  But it is also revealing to me that she just simply doesn’t care about my feelings and just feels like a lack of respect is creeping up in our relationship across various fronts and is being amplified by perimenopause.  \n\nThere is a part of me that says if she is just going to check out of our relationship and treat me with disrespect that I should begin pulling away from her and just no longer concern myself with with her issues and let her be.  Keep my side of the street clean and just worry about myself and the kids.  If she isn’t willing to work on our marriage or be an engaged partner in the marriage then why should worry about pulling extra weight or do extra to support her.  I feel like I am being taken for granted. At some point I have to draw the line and stand for my own self respect.  I ask myself many times if I would be so patient of this type of behavior from her if not for the perimenopause and mid life crisis?  The answer is of course not.  \n\nHowever I am concerned that if truly do pull back and pull away from her that I will begin to fall out of love.",
    "Sounds like more is wrong than just perimenopause.",
    "So therapist wants her to find herself… to me it sounds like she’s needs HRT in her life and not listen to what sounds like borderline man hating \n\nFor clarity I’m 45yo perimenopausal woman and have given my long-suffering lovely husband grief before I got on HRT",
    "If she wants menopausal help, avoid traditional gynecologists. They can do hysterectomies if needed but for treating hormones, they often don’t know shit, don’t care and will just F up women more than they already are. Seek out alternative medicine where they look at hormones and treat with bioidentical hormones and holistic medicine. My wife is looking into that now. Her gyno sucked at addressing her needs. Completely clueless. Just wanted to prescribe her narcotics instead of dealing with root causes.",
    "Your wife is now my wife. I completely understand your situation. My wife cut me off of sex though completely. She lives her life as a single person right now in our home with our children, just a roommate. We talk only about work or the weather, as she will refuse to talk about anything else. She goes out with friends but seriously acts like a single person. She ignores our kids. I have to sleep on the couch. \n\nFeel free to chat if you want to talk about our situations. \n\nI am glad I am not alone, but I also feel so very badly for all of us, including the women in our lives.",
    "The wife had her OB appt Monday. Were not in a place where she’s going to tell me everything so here’s what I know:\n\n- dr went through a list of symptoms and she said “I said yes to every single one.”\n\n- dr did do a blood test to check levels; I think that’s bc she had a uterine ablation a few years ago and so there’s no period, regular or irregular, to look at. \n\n- she’s going on “pills.” No more info than that. I can only imagine a combo pill. \n\nSo… what to expect in the next few weeks?",
    "My wife uses patches. Getting the right dosage is trial and error and might take a year or longer as she has to give them each a proper go. Hopefully she will feel better though there can be side effects like hair loss. Do not expect her to be back to “normal” as there are 3 chemicals in her body which can vary hugely on a daily basis so she will suffer bad days even on the right medication. She might suffer from brain fog and forget to renew her prescription so it might take a week or two to get medication. Maybe keep an eye on what she is taking and the dosage and if running low. This of course might make her angry that you are snooping",
    "Peri 45F Brit here…\n\nOk, so taking a blood test is pretty useless, it only tests hormone levels for that ONE DAY ONLY; we vary so much during the month that it’s seriously not worth it and is a tick box exercise\n\nIf she’s on a combo pill, that contains both estrogen and progesterone which is de facto HRT.  That might help her tbh.  It might not be the same levels as HRT but I’m actually quite glad that the doctor is giving her this rather than the usual “oh you’re just depressed here’s some Sertraline…”\n\nAs for timescale - proper HRT worked straight away for me, my moods and sweats levelled out so quick I thought I was imagining it",
    "One thing you may want to look into depending on your state is Magic mushrooms. I was in Michigan for a wedding and got some Bluey Vitton. It’s supposed to be good for self love and they use it for therapy I think. Anyway I got the tea and it took my “edge” off immediately. (Use some predetermined meditations of she decideda\nShe wants to go this route) As I relaxed more I got some thoughts from my brain. The first one I said to my husband “my brain wants me to be nicer to you. My body does too. I’m sorry. I can’t control myself right now. I need you to know I’m trying. I really am. “\n\nI also use the delta products (my state doesn’t have legal weed yet). But in g real it really helps. \n\nI also realized I’m autistic during menopause so if there’s any neurodiversity in the family that may be another area to look into. \n\nI also do HRT and swear by it. \n\nGood luck to you both. Thank you for being caring husband and looking for ways to help her. It just blame her. O can’t imagine how our mothers and grandmothers did this, just freebaliing without hormones. Menopausal rage is real and likely could be very lethal. \n\nAfter that my husband was a convert.",
    "It really depends on exactly what pills. My wife also had the ablation because she was having heavy bleeding for over half the month and was experiencing all the peri symptoms. \n\nYou likely are going to get an estrogen and progesterone tablet. My wife uses patches that are absorbed through the skin. Within a few days to a week you should see improvements. Brain fog will lift, less clumsy, mood improvement, and you may or may not see some libido increases. In our case we didn't see libido improvements until she added testosterone.",
    "Some symptoms might be relieved instantly. Others can takes weeks or a few months. If not, it usually takes about 3 months trial before dose changes are considered. Might need to change method if things aren’t working well. Some side effects may happen before things settle, particularly if it’s been a while since she’s has adequate estrogen. Progesterone is an issue for some women though I can’t recall how or why anymore. My wife hasn’t returned to “normal”. Hard for both of us but we’ve grown together so we’re managing.",
    "Good on you mate. My wife has picked up the patch HRT - yet this morning there was exasperation from her that she ‘still hasn’t remembered to start. which is good, cause that at least let me know she actually got them! Lol. Was in the dark as well.",
    "It took me about 10 months to find the optimal dose of E2. So try to be patient.",
    "My wife has just suggested to me about temporarily separating, this heartbreaking to hear. I’ve seen the struggles this phase in her life has brought on to her and it’s soul destroying. She has suffered with really bad depression and unfortunately I have a terminal illness.\n\nI wanted to ask how many others has this happened to and did they manage to work it through with their partner/wife and did things get better and they returned to living together",
    "We haven't separated, but my wife asks for a divorce a lot, like multiple times a week. Very little things irritate her and she seems to think every annoying thing about me is something \"you're doing on purpose to annoy me.\" I've been trying to be as small and quiet as possible to help minimize her annoyance. \n\nHas she taken any steps to separate or is it just threats with no action at this point? I usually tell her we can divorce if she wants, but can we just get through today/this week and deal with it later. Her moods are volatile and shift so quickly I don't know if she can be angry long enough to get it done. \n\nAny efforts to ask what I can do were fruitless, I think it's mostly blowing off steam.",
    "45F peri here… has she been to see a doctor about how she’s feeling, her symptoms? I’ve never asked my husband for divorce but I have had some seriously awful thoughts towards him, some quite aggressive!  But since I was put onto HRT it seriously sorted me out, and not just in no longer wanting to push him in the canal and hold his head under!!  A lot of peri women get misdiagnosed as needing antidepressants (although for some they do also work during this stage of life) so, providing she won’t bite your head off, I’d recommend putting it to her to speak with a GP, or if you speak with a mutual female friend or female relative to speak with her about it?\n\nAll the best, for you both 🙏🏻",
    "I’m sorry to hear about your illness. I hope you’re doing ok at the moment. I can’t imagine how much harder it makes dealing with everything this time of life throws up. Hopefully something from my experience can give you some hope for your relationship. \n\nMy wife got really unwell with perimenopause and couldn’t function by herself for a while. We probably would have separated if she wasn’t so sick. HRT has helped but she still is having a rough time though is a lot better than before. _We_ are doing well though - now.\n\nShe says she has an internal drive that makes her want to move to a cabin in the woods and never speak to anyone again. She says the feeling is incredibly real but thinks it’s _related_ to hormones because she can wake up one day and feel it like it’s the only thing that can make her happy then a week later feel, not the opposite but neutral. She says it’s a lot to do with how she feels about her life and the demands she’s dealing with, like her parents who aren’t acting great towards her as they get older. She can ignore those feelings when her hormones are settled but can’t when they’re in flux.  \n\nHow she acted on her down days used to cause me all kinds of fears and worries and stress. It used to feel very personal and unjust to me and I, in turn, acted just as badly towards her. I felt offended and scared and would push back. \n\nBut now we’ve got an agreement where if she’s feeling it or I notice she’s feeling it, we acknowledge it and we both give her some extra care and leeway. It took a lot of work on my part to respond instead of reacting and a great counsellor to point out that we’re both acting in the same way to something in our environment that we don’t like, but hers is happening in her internal environment and mine is in my relationship. (Hers is also less of a choice but the similarity was pointed out more for my understanding). \n\nNow we’re in on this thing together whereas before it was pushing us apart. \n\nI think this is a time when we all need extra help from people who are trained to understand what’s going on - counsellors, GPs etc. You’d think they would be but the majority are not. She saw multiple doctors and specialists for multiple symptoms that didn’t respond to medications or lifestyle changes for years before one even mentioned perimenopause. I saw a counsellor who told me, essentially, that if she’s being such a bitch I should consider leaving. What I actually needed was understanding of what was going on and new skills to deal with it. Perimenopause/menopause tightens the screws on relationships and any weaknesses show up big and fast. \n\nMy big gripe is that we’ve had to learn everything the hard way, as in after problems started and became ingrained in our lives. I see this in all of my friends’ and colleagues’ relationships too. You’re not alone in your experience and neither is she.",
    "Sorry to hear about your condition. My situation is similar to the person above - I think that it's just like a pressure relief valve that gets blasted open every now and then. Two days later, back to some kind of level playing field for a bit. It's possible that youre experiencing the same. Good luck",
    "My wife has said things but then her head goes back to normal. After a while I have become less upset by the “threats” but still upsetting",
    "My wife moved out few months ago, says I’m great, relationship was great but she feels she can’t give me what I need right now, I deserve better etc and she’s horrible to me (she’s not) \n\nI’m at home looking after my stepson..some days she’s completely irrational and unpleasant…others we have a laugh and spend time together. It’s really weird..she’s very much in denial about the whole thing but has a doctors appointment to look at things \n\nHopefully she gets help she needs because she isn’t the person I met and married, even her kids have noticed her change",
    "Truly sorry to hear what you’ve been going through. I can’t imagine having to face your own illness and your wife’s struggles at the same time. I doubt anyone can really say what they’d do in your situation if they haven’t been in it. But I feel like personally I would want to start by telling her how much I needed her. I don’t see it as a selfish thing. If you genuinely believe that being together is the best thing for both of you, which presumably is why you got married originally, then trying to get her to stay is the right thing to do. \n\nAnd after that, if she insists she wants to separate, then take her seriously and talk about it seriously. Either she’ll start feeling differently and she’ll decide to stay, or she’ll feel the same and there will be nothing left to do but let her try it. \n\nEverybody has to follow the thing that’s going to bring them peace. Hopefully she’s wrong about a separation bringing her peace. If she is, then she’ll know it as soon as she tries to go.",
    "Sorry; I’ll delete if everyone hates it. \n\nWins this week: last night we actually sat and watched a movie and then a couple episodes of a show. She chatted throughout.  No physical contact, where we would usually lay on each other or I’d put my hand on her leg, but ok. \n\nWhen she went to bed (after getting ready for bed in our room) she said (good naturedly) “off to my chamber” as she went to the guest room. \n\nI keep seeing more and more symptoms. She’s complaining more of body aches. Last night she was so itchy that in her words “I want to claw my skin off.” As always, temperature regulation is nowhere to be found. And of course, the annoyed with everything. \n\nBut I have a new strategy. Tell me what you think of this. I just act like she’s making snarky jokes. Last night the kid had to swish salt water for a mouth sore and she said “I’ll get you some ibuprofen.” I said “oh my gosh great idea I don’t know why I didn’t think of that after the ortho” and she said kind of sarcastically “oh, yeah… good idea I do have those” and my only response was “of course you do! I’m just marveling at how dumb I am!”\n\nWhen she was itching I said “that’s a menopause thing, I bet” and she said “oh, doctor over here Mr know it all” and acted like she was pushing her glasses up and I just laughed. She asked what was so funny and I just said “it’s funny; I know I’m not a know it all” and smiled and laughed more. She kept going with the voice etc and I just laughed with her. \n\nShe has an OB appt on Monday and I need some input: I am scared she’s going to say “eh it’s not that bad” or the doc is going to go “yep you seem ok” and no real discussion. \n\nHow can I share a sentiment like “hey I want you to feel better; you know I read about this stuff just like you do—can I share a few things before you go to the doc?”\n\nOr, as a stupid male, is this just more infantilizing, misogynistic crap that I’ve been conditioned to think is “helpful?”\n\nNow that I write that I feel like I know the answer. \n\nEdit: just left to take the kid somewhere and got a hug and I love you. Now, operation back off. ",
    "All I can say is it's great you care, and there is nothing misogynistic about wanting to understand. Offering advice is a little mansplain-ey, which you're not doing. Trying to make her laugh and giving her space by taking the kid are also really great tools. :) \n\nThat said, if her doctor gaslights her by saying she's \"normal\" when there are signs everywhere that she's clearly not, please support her by suggesting she try to work with someone who will actually listen.",
    "Everyone is different, but I find less talking and more listening works better for us.",
    "My wife gets the itchy skin and also has said I want to claw my skin off. My wife is on HRT patches and though not perfect certainly helps her (and me). A sense of humour and communication helps. Keep going!!!",
    "45F here, and peri. I’m gonna guess here that you’re both in the U.S.?  And if you are it seems so much more difficult to get HRT than here in the U.K. (if you’re UK then please seek a second opinion!)\n\nHear me out here. Yes I’m English. Yes I can flounce to my GP and more often than not get HRT - yes I’m very more aware that we get prescribed antidepressants more than HRT, which is very frequent here - but from what you’ve described then HRT would do you both the world of good. It honestly starts working straight away. I had such awful feelings towards my husband, even when he was being so lovely with back rubs, foot massages etc.  I would have happily smothered him in his sleep for breathing! \n\nPlease if you can… without fear of being stabbed (we want to!!) get her through hook or by crook get her some HRT. I don’t know why so many docs don’t want to give us women HRT - gel etc does NOT increase cancer risk, it’s not the 90s!!  \n\nAnd stay strong. Stay lovely - you seem so!",
    "Here's the deal, the OB will listen to you and give credence to what you say over what your wife says. It's infuriating, but it has been shown that we get better, more attentive care if there is a man in there making our case. So be ready to talk about what you see: \"the itching drives her nuts and all, but the sleeplessness is really taking a toll on her.\" and \"I'm concerned about X\"\n\nYou've been with this woman for years, you know what depression looks like on her. If the doc just suggests antidepressants, speak up for her - that you've seen her depressed, anxious, etc., and you feel that it's not the right treatment. (unless your wife is interested in trying them) \n\nGo to all the appointments you can with her. Be her advocate. Plan ahead and go into the appointment with one mind. Try to have questions prepared in advance to the extent you can. If she does start meds or HRT, make notes on how you've seen change in her mood, behavior, etc., and share those with her as a check in - she's experiencing it internally, you're observing it externally. It can help her process her experience more.\n\nThis is such an important way you can support her: be a voice doctors will listen to. Not because she can't, of course she can. Because this is too important to have to fight any harder than we have to in the exam room. Get the fucking healthcare",
    "Honestly, being someone a lot further down the road and would die to be in your state of marriage... you just need to take the wins and forget the losses. Like your edit said, that was a win, take that in... anything negative you have to put your mind in a happy place and just be nonchalant supportive. It sucks, but if you truly want your marriage to continue, you need to realize your situation is impervious to \"strategies\". I would just let the Dr do his thing and reassess if they don't suggest hrt or something. This is just my opinion, coming from someone the would give his left nut for 10 mins of watching a tv show like we used to happily do for a couple hrs a night just 3 short years ago. It can get so much worse, just be supportive even though it seems snowflakey if you have been kind of an alpha-ish, non-assy, welcomed leader type husband like I was for 20+ yrs. Giving you advice I wish I had a few yrs ago.",

Same stories as everyone. \n\nFor a year prior she’d been telling me (and our therapist who we stopped seeing in November 2023) “everything’s great! Nothing to talk about” and then September rolled around and she’s “never been happy ever and leaving.”\n\nSince then she’s gone back and forth between “I’m not going anywhere I love you” to “I tried to shove my feelings down but I can’t.”\n\nAll I say is “I don’t want you to shove anything down; I want to talk, go back to our awesome therapist; figure it out” and the response is just 🤷‍♂️\n\nShe has an appointment on the 17th with her ob to talk hormones. \n\nIs there hope that if some estrogen gets in the mix that she’ll chill a little to take the time to try here?",

You just need to see it’s not her per se..the huge shifts in moods show that. My wife moved out to her friends as she couldn’t cope with anything..left me dealing with her kids(step kids) she feels lost etc, but they feel distancing from us is the reason..they don’t see the drop in hormones can make it feel they don’t love us..or they feel guilty we deserve better as they can’t offer what we want right now. \n\nFirst thing you need to realise brother is it will never be as it was, it’s called the change for a reason. Now that’s not to say hrt can’t make it almost as it was..but I find if you just maintain structure and maintain your reliability it will help.

    "100% BUT finding the right Dr who knows hormones is key. It's maddening how hard this was!\n\nSkip the 3-6 months wait to figure out you are with the wrong Dr by asking ask if they include testosterone, if its needed. If they say no or some version of \"it can cause cancer,\" leave and find a new Dr.\n\nWOMEN NEED T!\n\nEstrogen is only one part. She will need E, T, P, DHEA, DIM and all supporting supplements and essential aminos in order for her body to be able to actually make use of the HRT. A good provider will give you a full protocol based on her blood results. If not, keep looking for one...\n\nShe should also have a bone density scan done and full blood test with Iron/ferritin, SHBG and all supporting hormone panels.

But now there’s a little bit of space btw my reaction and my eventual response to that reaction. Apparently that one helps with self love.\n\nLike others have discussed, usually the stimuli or trigger is real and something the needs to be understood and addressed. My reaction and emotional response is exaggerated. So I’m getting better about standing up for myself without bring down the bridge.\n\nMy husband is 1000% in support of the magic mushroomes now. If you live or are near a star where they’re legal (MI and CO and probably others) spend a few minutes with the doper selling them. They e very very knowledgeable.

    "Is this a menopause thing to bring up topics from 30 yrs old and say how my in laws treated her and that I was not supportive then ?\nWe have two kids and now we are on the verge of separation \nI am reaching my limits too.\nShe is on some estrogen patch.\n\n\n",
    "Woman in perimenopause checking in here. I have found since hitting my mid-forties that memories I thought I had dealt with are coming back as flashbacks. Things that I had ignored or things that I had swept under the rug or things that I had not given myself the time and space to adequately respond to are coming back in full force. \n\n\nWell the hormones may be triggering some of this most of what comes back are ways that I felt I was minimized or harmed in my life and I did not adequately address them or others did not adequately amend for them in ways that felt resolved. \n\n\nAnd just because they happened a long time ago doesn't mean they feel irrelevant now. As estrogen lowers the imperative to play nice and to make ourselves small gets lower. We are less likely that ever before to put up with bad treatment. \n\n\nSouthern seems to be a period of reflection from the past with new eyes that requires a new kind of closure.\n\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, this is not a bad thing at all that your partners are bringing up the past. It is an opportunity to speak about it at length together and see how together you guys can reframe what happened and make amends if it's needed or necessary. \n\n\nIf by objectively looking at the situation and seeing that perhaps you did not defend her like you should have this is an opportunity to let her know that you see it now and that you're sorry for not stepping in when you should have. And don't do that with a whole plate of reasons why you did it All you need to do is say that you're sorry that you see it now. \n\n\nHonestly, it's a good thing she's bringing this up that means she's wanting to make repairs. You should completely worry if she's gone totally radio silent. That's the time to be very worried. \n\n\nBut if you find yourself defensive about some of the things she's bringing up I encourage you to explore the reasons behind that. \n\n\nMenopause is a huge transitional phase for women and it's not just physical it is mental emotional and even spiritual. Relationships that make it through are once that also transition which means they cannot play by the same old rulebook. I do believe however, that the transition if made in good faith by both parties will lead to a much better relationship moving forward. ",
    "If she's been punching down these feelings for 30 years , NOW is when they will come out.

If she’s gone back in time, maybe you can go there alongside her - tell her you regret those actions, and the man you are today would never have acted like that or allowed that to happen. Apologise unreservedly. Assuming it’s all true. If not, maybe it’s time to do some reflecting yourself. Midlife is a tricky tricky time of life and whoever taught us it would be an easy ride was wrong or cruel. Good luck mate.",
    "My guess is even though they happened in the past they don’t feel like past hurts to your partner. They unfortunately are probably continual issues on her side. The only way to know though is to ask and be open to listening to the answer.",
    "Yes, definitely. We've been together since 18 and she recently brought up how angry she felt about me getting drunk and kissing another girl at a party. In 1989. I am told I don't consider her or do anything nice for her, and has no guidance on how I could improve. If she has to explain it then I'm too lazy to do it.",
    "This isn't menopause per se, but a common midlife crisis kind of dynamic. Both men and women do this. You reach a certain point in life, and you start to wonder what the rest of your life looks like. Especially if you aren't particularly happy. So you look at the past, and it brings up a lot of shit.\n\nSo to me, this isn't so much about the past as much as it is about right now. However, you should push back on dredging that shit up to bash you with. She will continue doing what you allow. This isn't a time to be passive and defensive. This is a time to enforce boundaries and lead.",
    "OP, I look back on the time when I didn’t take progesterone at bedtime &amp; wear an estrogen patch. Prior to these HRT, my mind would shuffle the ideas from my long term memory, and the lack of ability to (easily, if at all) create short term memories, caused my logic errors: in dealing with those long term memories.\n\n\nI wish my mind had not accessed those long term memories but I wasn’t in charge at that time. Without HRT, I couldn’t detect that I needed HRT, and no one knows me well, out here where my job and home are, so no one told me that my brain wasn’t functioning due to lacking such critical components as the progesterone needed to get to sleep. And the estrogen needed to stay asleep. I hadn’t slept well for too long of a time, so the lack of sleep (due to lacking progesterone &amp; estrogen) resulted in psychosis. Which ended after HRT",
    "we like to check the backlogs for sure. the estrogen is likely poking around in your wife’s psyche and emotions. that, and also, i agree with it’s not so much menopause but a juncture in life as human beings where we begin to question the past. we begin to question *every*thing. \n\ntake into account that a good majority here are probably GenX, or at least can remember a time when things weren’t so complicated as they are today. we weren’t tethered to an electronic rectangle and we know what patience is all about. times were easier and everything was in the moment. we yearn for that *now* as we wrestle with who we really are in our 40s and 50s, and yet there are fibers within that simpler time when we were growing up and becoming adults that were very complex and painful. so we begin to wonder and worry and ponder, and we put a microscope on it; how we were raised, our first loves, our first heartbreaks, etc. and the truth is that we never remember things exactly as they happened. each time we pull that memory up, there’s a little something different or skewed in how we remember it. sometimes we embellish it to make it a little better, and sometimes it’s worse.\n\nit hurts her now because she probably feels like she should have spoken up then. she kept this in, or hell, maybe you two spoke about it or whatever, but she still stings from that. and it may not be the way it actually was, but how it how it made her feel and the heft of lugging it around all this time is the issue. sit down with her or take her for a ride. listen to her. she obviously needs to talk about this. let her know you will listen and be there for her…i wish you all the best, dude. this phase is not easy on any of us ✌️",

Though it’s not fair on us, it helps to remember that she is suffering many times more in those moments. If that reaction is not what she would have done before this hormonal chaos started, it’s not her and it comes from inner suffering. \n\nThis might not be your situation, but sometimes a bad response to a kindness is from a build up of resentment that bizarrely comes out in moments of kindness. Confusing, but unresolved relationship issues start to leak out during moments like that. If it is the case, seeing it as part of a bigger picture can help. \n\nIn these moments of feeling offended, hurt, rejected, etc - though it’s hard - try to be understanding towards your own feelings as well as the overall situation. They’re legitimate feelings but the situation itself is the unjust cause - if she’d received adequate healthcare and advice over the previous few years, it’s unlikely this would have happened today.

    "Doctors have not been any help.\nMaybe she feels the same way.\nI had to self medicated bc I couldn't get NO help.",
    "These are hard times my friend. The medical system really has a lot to answer for in this kind of situation. My wife spent years going from doctor to doctor for her worsening health until she found one at her lowest point who, as she tells it, brightly said as though it was the simplest most obvious thing in the world “oh that sounds like perimenopause!” Questionnaire to confirm, popped her on HRT, and within a few days things started looking up. It was so goddam simple that I became furious at her unnecessary suffering and had to go for lots of runs so I didn’t explode. Our trust in doctors is very low. I think she has medical ptsd but she’s not ready to work that out rn. \n\nWife thinks your wife’s reluctance to bring up menopause might be the sad result of the woeful medical care and accompanying disrespect women receive for hormonal issues throughout their lives. If hormonal issues are suspected, nothing else is taken seriously from that point forward. But don’t expect adequate medical solutions and advice for said hormonal issues. The more doctors she visits trying to get better care, the more she’ll be thought of as a difficult patient who is “doctor shopping”. It snowballs from there. \n\nWife and I chatted but don’t know how we would go about your situation. She felt like hell and can’t imagine someone not wanting to address this. But she also didn’t know it was perimenopause that was aggravating all her previously managed health issues and piling on 100 more. She also says she may have divorced me if I tried to tell her how to do things at the time - I wasn’t being a great partner to her in other ways then and my “superior take” would have been the final straw. \n\nSome options we discussed about your situation - which we obviously don’t know all of and that is influenced heavily by our experience - was to come at it from a perspective that you’re realising how hard these health conditions are on her and that you want to be a better partner to her while she’s trying to work through them. Ask how you can take some of the burden of that - like researching doctors with special interest in her conditions, booking appointments, accompanying her to make sure she’s treated like a human not just a woman, researching the conditions so you can find ways to relieve her symptoms or in the least try to understand what’s happening in her body. (Or just start washing the dishes and picking up milk on your way home etc without being asked!) \n\nThen you could probably bring up that hormone loss / fluctuation (with perimenopause) can aggravate existing medical conditions and go from there. The point is that you’re showing (not telling her you care) by being educated on her experience and not just making it about you. It’s ok that some of it is about you of course but it just not all of it. \n\nBear in mind the vast majority of doctors don’t know any more about perimenopause /menopause than the average person on the street. She’ll need to be very lucky (don’t rely on luck) or go to a menopause clinic which comes with long wait times and higher fees. And watch out for the predatory ones. \n\nWe both want to emphasise that midlife requires a broad change in the status quo. Things that used to work no longer do. None of our older family or friends told us this, they just suffered through or divorced. But it goes for everything in our lives. She said the most obvious example for her was maintaining her weight and mood - she always was healthy, exercised, ate well, meditated, journaled, got counselling, you name it. Suddenly, they weren’t working. She did more of the same but it didn’t help. She had to change _how_ she managed these things. On reflection over a long period of time we both realised this was true for pretty much everything - health, relationships, work, how we think about things… \n\nSo, being more of your fine self might not help and the increased effort with no observable impact is going to be beyond frustrating. It’s a difficult change to deal with it being on the back foot. If we had at least known we were entering new territory with new unknown rules, things would have been much easier. \n\nWe think this is why a lot of guys go for second, younger wives and women go for no partners. But, speaking from the guy perspective with friends and family who did or are doing this, it’s just kicking the can down the road. It _will_ come up again. \n\nSo, long rambling answer that may or may not help you out but it lead to a great conversation with my own wife. While things aren’t perfect here and we would have gladly never gone through that rough patch in the first place, we are both happier and closer than ever. There is light at the end of the tunnel and the tunnel probably isn’t as long or dark as it feels.",

Maybe ask her to write something on how you make her feel when she is in a non menopausal place. You can read when she is angry.",
    "Absolutely second encouraging  her to get some sort of HRT going and complain complain complain until she gets prescribed a combination that actually helps. I was so horrifically angry and violent (towards drywall, not living things) until I got on a more helpful dosage and it took an exhausting amount of self advocacy to get prescribed anything better. \n\nPlease put yourself first in this situation, without medication nothing you say or do will make a difference anyway",
    "HRT isn't the answer for all women, but channelling your frustration and stress into something more positive can help, my partner has found that going out for a run or bike ride does the trick.",
    "Wife (52) has menopause, really really bad. Support from GP is pretty useless. Basically here's some patches off you go ...\n\nI am supporting her but I feel selfish for saying this, but I am tired. I am the target of everything. Someone drives pulls out in front of her .. it's my fault. We went away the other week .. had a great time but got lost walking to the railway station ... My fault. From that point on, everything was bad. The station .. even the train being over crowded ... And yep all directed at me. \nI know this isn't her, but am I bad for wanting some respite or even just an occasional sorry. \n\nI've got to the point that I'm too scared to try and talk to her. \n",
    "My dude, we've all been there; you're all good.  What you're feeling is a natural response to the situation.  The question to ask is how receptive she'd be to discussing how her changes are affecting you.  If she's agreeable, then start small with things she'll be able to easily do.  Set her up for success.  \n\nFor example, we have codeword 'brimstone'.  This means \"I am really pissed off, not necessarily at *you*, and am leaving the room to cool off.  Do NOT follow me.\".  We have it because she acknowledged her angry snaps were hurting us and it was an easy way to quickly limit future ones.  Not \"stop being mad at me\", which would fail, but \"let's try to redirect or lower anger when it happens\", which is much easier to succeed at.\n\nBut know we're here for you, and know there are several kind and helpful women who frequent the sub.  Their insight is simply the best!",
    "It’s so tiring bearing the brunt of menopausal distress. My wife also recognises this. There is hope though! Our relationship is stronger than ever now that we’re through the worst of it and I put a lot of that down to my own efforts. She’s always been an excellent partner and peri (still going) has been rough on her. It turned out that I was the one who had to make the biggest changes - but don’t let that put you off. Worth it. \n\nFirst, are you looking after yourself? Eating and sleeping well, exercising, starting hydrated, watching how much you drink etc? Midlife is hard for blokes too and we need to make sure we stay on top of our physical and mental health if we want to stay healthy, strong, resilient. Can’t recommend enough how helpful counselling can be to develop skills to deal with new midlife challenges. The skills that worked for early life challenges don’t always carry through this life stage. \n\nIf your wife is acting like this, she’s likely feeling as drained as you are, if not more because of the physiology of menopause.  But psychologically, two drained souls at once is tough - so don’t make big decisions. Reassess other responsibilities and get rid of the least important or most draining demands so you (both) have more space for dealing with the challenges individually and together. \n\nThe advice from others about working out a plan for when she’s feeling her worst is great. Not sure how to suggest it from this side though! Seems my wife was more aware of this because she felt so out of control of her emotions after having gained mastery over them over the years through counselling and meditation. She would let me know her emotions weren’t about me (assuming I wasn’t being an ass!) and one of us would remove ourselves from the situation. I eventually stopped feeling like she was angry at me (something I don’t tolerate well) and could support her. I now feel really empathetic and protective when she hits a rough patch. To my surprise, I feel like a freaking giant when I can help her. I realised I had this internal fear that I’d feel small or weak or less somehow, like I’d given in where I wasn’t supposed to. Can’t pinpoint where this came from but it was there and I nearly lost her because of it. \n\nIt’s easy to say don’t take it personally but harder to feel it. It took concerted effort to convince myself it wasn’t me in that moment. I used to visualise her as unwillingly caught in a painful emotional geyser, kind of like when the Doctor (Who) regenerates and the intense energy overwhelms him. Imperfect analogy but it’s easier to see how overwhelming it is and how it’s not related to bystanders but sometimes they get caught up in it. Freeing when you can do it though. \n\nLastly, are her patches strong enough? My wife needed a much higher dose before she felt better. Raising that with her was hard though. Focus on how _she’s_ feeling when you chat. Eg, you don’t seem to be feeling good despite the patches and I don’t think your GP understands how debilitating menopause can be. How do you feel about … This may not be taken well if there are underlying issues - a common issue I never understood is when the wife has been carrying the lion’s share of household burden for other capable adults in the home (and/or capable older children) and suddenly becomes aware of this but the recipients of her care do not step up in response to her requests. 😳\n\nManaging menopause and relationships is tricky but not impossible. Know that there’s light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "hello OP u/oldskool_gent “OSG” I lived through what your wife has. I do agree with u/SirGeeks-a-lot about having the insight. \n\n\n\nOP, I’m going to take a guess at the prioritization of your questions (but pls lmk if you can prioritize them for our discussion here).\n\n\n\n1) “I’m too scared to try and talk to her”\n\n\nOP: I am aware that there can be a wide array of experiences that she may be having.\n\n\nYou may have very good reason to be afraid.\n\n\nIn that light, among the many purpose of a “couples counselor” is to have another person present while “talking” about anything. \n\n\nIt is much safer. \n\n\nWe don’t know how much fear is reasonably justified, but people have inadvertently hurt themselves, just trying to have an unmediated conversation.\n\n \nI saw someone give themselves a hairline fracture: by slamming their fist down against a heavy stone table.\n\n\nYet, no one intended any harm. But, these situations where fear is experienced: is warranted.\n\n\n&lt;&lt; I have more to add, but I wanted to address: what I see, as the highest priority, first. &gt;&gt;",
    "It’s not easy but you do have the energy. Emotional crap is tiring. As you know it’s not your wife it’s the menopause. I find I have become more used to outbursts after the initial few times. Still pisses me off but I don’t react as much and less impact. Meditation works quite well for me to relax so make some time for you to recharge your batteries",
    "I just want to say that Menopause is difficult, but I tell you I would never consistently berrat someone I love. You definitely need to tell her how this makes you feel, and I hope your wife is on HRT and to perhaps get a better doctor. Menopause is all about getting the right medication and advocating for yourself. I wish you all the best.",
    "Thank you all, some things to ponder on. You are all right tho, it's not her it's the menopause talking. Sometimes perhaps I lose that focus.",
    "I understand, bro. I'm almost at the end of my rope, too. My wife's rage is only occasional. I mostly get small negative comments about how I'm doing things throughout the evening. I'm also tired of the forced celibacy. I do my best to be supportive and act like nothing is wrong.\n\nI hear my inner voice telling me all the time. I signed up to Marry a woman. I thought that was the opposite vow of priesthood. It feels like because she's having these difficulties that I'm not allowed to have feelings or react.\n\nI try and suppress it, but I feel myself getting more and more irritated with no sex and she's criticizing me for small things. It's really hard not to say something back.",
    "Sounds like she may need to work with someone, other than a GP who is pretty worthless at anything other than writing prescriptions. Would she be open to a menopause/ hormone functional health specialist? Will change both your lives...",
    "Woman here who's sometimes a raging inferno - see the scene in Maleficent when Angelina Jolie realizes she was betrayed. I laughed and did some high kicks when I saw that scene (we watched it last night, AFTER I threatened to throw a hammer through our f'ing TV because we couldn't figure out how to reconnect the bluray) but my poor partner was a bit traumatized.  I have to say many of the comments here are so touching - you guys really care, and deal with difficult situations,  and seem to be in touch with your own feelings,  which will serve you well.  Hopefully this can be a time of learning and growth for both parties. ",
    "Anyone dealing with this one?\n\nShe just up and blindsided me the beginning of May 2023. She already had a place and she took the kids, \"we're done,\" I talked her into couples therapy, but she still moved out.\n\nI tried to give her space, but \"I\" hurt. My life walked out the door. She slowly let me back in, it started to get better, and I was slammed again. It has become a cycle.\n\nThe therapist brought up perimenopause and she latched on, but that was a very bitter battle until she finally gave in to get HRT, roughing 8 months of fighting. They helped, but she hasn't been back to get adjusted.\n\nWe had a hard conversation and she agreed to move back October 2023, she did, but kept the apartment, and all was going good. Her eldest has had some issues and just went off to a facility. Things were back to calm, her lease was ending, and she was handling all the paperwork to close it out. 2 weeks before she would turn in the keys, \"I resigned the lease,\" and \"I'm moving out, I need to fix me\".... April 2024.\n\nI am broken. Every Single Time it gets good I get the wind knocked out of me. I can see through the fog a little, we aren't getting knocked back as far, but is almost the beginning again.\n\nSex is basically gone. My trust is destroyed. I'm scared to talk most of the time.\n\nThere are moments that she (the woman I love) resurfaces for a week and I rush to have all the important conversations and she is receptive (kinda), until I'm blasted back to hell.\n\nI'm starting to lose the will and when I tell her that she is mean and spiteful.\n\nI love and miss her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nThis time around I have REALLY tried to give more space and she has been \"When I move back...\" basically the whole time, like this is some adventure.\n\nCurrently, we seem to be doing well, 2 weeks. We had a brief fight, but she is going to schedule an appointment for the HRT evaluation.\n\nIt is the Hope and The Slam that kills me.",

So I didn’t know all these symptoms was a thing I can accept the fact that she doesn’t want to have sex with me, but for 30 years, she told me I was the best thing came into her life. But now the past five years, no sex no intimacy she hasn’t even allow me to touch her unless she’s cold and wants to be warmed up. We haven’t kissed since October 16. She occasionally let me go down on her  but that’s it and tells me I’m no longer big enough for her needs. I’m semi retired so I take care of the house. I drive to work pick her up so she doesn’t have to. She prefers it and no, she’s not having an affair as far as I can tell because there’s no telltale signs no hiding the phone. I’m already on antidepressants, I don’t know what to do. I think she’ll be better off without me please help what can I do? What have I done?

There are good reasons of course, like individual high risk for or active hormone positive cancer. But many believe it outright causes cancer, which is not the case. \n\nIf you can, see a menopause specialist.

Let's talk about Menopause\" by Ruth Devlin) and wanted to seek out more advice.\n\nI want to be as supportive and caring for her as I possibly can.  We share equally in childcare duties (our daughter is 10) and household work already (I do the grocery shopping, the bulk of the cooking, and roughly half of the general cleaning/laundry).  I try to be an active listener and show that I hear and remember what she's talking about.  I try to be sympathetic to her aches, pains, mood swings, and other discomforts.  I make sure I let her know I love her and find her attractive, especially since she's talking about some dysmorphia issues.  I show her that I'm happy for her when she feels good about something (like workout results or a meal she made that she's proud of).  And, though it's really difficult, I'm trying to not take things personally when her mood is off.\n\nWhat other things can I do to help her out (be that emotionally, physically, or otherwise) without seeming like I'm trying to \"fix\" things for her?

    "It sounds like you're doing a great job supporting her so far!  \n\nOne suggestion that a lot of male partners don't consider is that women are usually the ones doing the most 'mental load'.  This is the planning, scheduling, remembering, etc. that keeps the family running.  Calling the school if your kid is sick, remembering when picture day is, noticing she needs new winter boots, scheduling the family's dental appointments, arranging holiday plans with family, booking travel tickets, making the grocery list, meal planning, etc.  Having a partner take on more of this mental and emotional labour would be so helpful for me.  Especially because one of the common menopause symptoms is mental fatigue and worsening memory.\n\nMy additional piece of advice, is to just be there for her and give her grace when needed.  She may not need you to do more, and no matter how much you do you can't change what she's experiencing, so accept that there will hard times and you won't always be able to avoid them. Sometimes there is nothing you can do to help and just is what it is, but know that it isn't forever.",

Why are there not better methods to better track circulating (blood) hormone levels to provide better understanding of where a woman is on her journey?

    "Moved in with my GF this year. 2nd anniversary this month. Perimenopause has been hitting for 6 months, but we've known for 2. Ramble incoming:\n\nYou ever see how women and their periods were portrayed in sitcoms and pop culture and think \"what the \\*fuck\\* are they talking about?? Why would you be at the bar because of your wife's cycle? Why would you talk about her that way? What universal understanding makes these sorts of jokes relatable at all??\n\nGuess it was menopause, not the menstrual cycle.\n\nI'm trying so hard to help her to view me as an ally. She feels like she's flawed because she can't control how she acts and that makes her try harder to control how she's behaving on her own and this just puts me at odds with her because I'm still just carrying the weight of her feelings all the time either way, but the only good times we have are when she accepts how she's feeling and lets me help. I can't solve her problem, but I can help her with her powerlessness. But she's responding from her most \"nobody can help me\" space and I can't just ignore her.\n\nAnd it all eats into some really important things I'm working on, and I find myself wanting desperately - when she's had her period - to take a turn to isolate myself for my needs, but I need to fucking model good mutually supportive behavior and all of this stuff means that my jobhunting and career development - which SHE NEEDS me to be committed and productive on - suffer whether she handles Peri in a way that's fucking coupled or not.\n\nI'm so frustrated. I need her to get on board with working in this new reality, but then she hates herself for the effort this takes out of things we both care about.

But I crave intimacy and remember the youthful passion we once had.\n\nTalking about this with my wife has been tough. She feels threatened that she cannot keep up with my labido. That I think she is old .  Fortunately, I was able to convince her to start HRT. The Doctor even gave her testosterone.  I am hopeful we can improve things.",

And most of the time it’s in his head as well but hell if it helps him…!  All I can say from experience of both of us not being as young, sprightly etc is first talk and be open, take your time and not put pressure on each other. It’s a partnership for a reason 😀 none of us are getting any younger",

When are intimate, she seems bored and uninterested. She has told me she does not like penetration - that she gets nothing out of it and prefers I give her oral and let her go to bed - no other four play.  It’s always something. I find if I leave her alone and don’t ask for sex she will just sit on her phone all night watching tic toks. We have been married for 21 years since we were 19.

A movie in with her favorite pizza or snacks. **NO sex** but snuggles when/if she wants them and space when she needs that- as soon as she needs it (hot flashes are real) or something else simple that shows her that you feel she is a priority?\n\nA lot of times we feel like we're defficient, broken, unlovable, unworthy of love or just expected to keep the status quo when our entire world and body is falling apart infront of our eyes. That can be exhausting, depressing, infuriating and overwhelming to say the least, so knowing our partner has our back and loves us even when we're rage filled mess of sweat and tears is exactly what we need the very most. \n\nTo be clear- **your feelings are valid** but if she's too overwhelmed by her stuff she's not gonna be in any way receptive to your shit and trying to talk to her is gonna end badly.\n\nI would strongly suggest making her a priority and trying to find a **non sexual** way to connect as a couple for the next few weeks and see if she naturally opens up about the things she's struggling with or is willing to talk with some mild encouragement. \n\n**DO NOT give her a special day and then just dump your purse!!** Thats not cool and she'll be furious with every right to be, and it could prevent success in any future efforts. Give her time, and make that time about her as much as you can.\n\nI can honestly say that my husband was able to break through to me once he humbled himself, showed me I mattered and let me know he has my back and now we walk this crazy path together.

She's going through a tough and weird time and needs extra support. That DOESN'T mean you need to be abused, but it does mean you are required to give more grace. Tell her what you are going through and listen to her struggles as well so you can attack these issues TOGETHER.\n\n  \nI'm not going to tell you to \"hang in there\" or that \"it will get better\", because (seemingly, for me at least) this is what it is for the time being, but I'm pretty sure you're going to be ok if you are willing to put in the work and keep your mind right.\n\n  \nOr maybe we'll get rooms next to each other in the crazy bin someday.

We have to wait for the system to become renewed in the new current environment.) \n\nThink of menopause like drug withdrawal symptoms for a hard core junkie. I think the bio process is similar. Their nervous system is measured up. \n\nThis is very isolating. Makes you feel very confused, alone and it’s extremely isolating - even from other women. \n\nFor me, I have an extremely hard time forming and maintaining emotional connections. Our marriage and my husband has been “farming” all the emotional load to me. \n\nFinally, many Boomer and GenX women are learning that they are neurodiverse. I figured out my ADHD was actually AuDHD. Thats a while different grieving process. I’m autistic. And menopause made me boot any mask I had ever developed. I do not care about making anyone else happy anymore. If they are great. But my primary focus is my health, my energy, my stress load. \n\nMany families realize how out of balance their households are during menopause. \n\nJust some additional food for thought and perspective. \n\nMenopausal rage is real.

I think she thinks she is too young for this. I don’t know how to tell her what I see from the outside looking in, out of a bit of fear.  Our relationship has been rocky for the last few years,  lots to do with how I have been ( a bit of depression and anxiety). But I have been doing my best to make me a better human for me, her and the ones we raise.

I’ve noticed quite a difference as well where you are, I’m UK and we seem to get a bit more support than that I’ve seen from women in different countries. \n\nI’ve been peri for a couple or so years and until the last month or so once I realised it WAS peri and I didn’t actually hate my husband and every other breathing human around me, then we started talking and realising and it made a huge difference in how we react to each other - we don’t have raging arguments anymore for example\n\nIf you’re having 2 weeks nice 2 weeks hate then it reads to me that she does need some hormonal balance. If she’s not wanting to go down the HRT route (and I thought I was too young…) then I was recommended wild yam as an estrogen replacement, but there also needs to be a contra-hormone (progesterone) to prevent uterine cancer issues.  Personally I’m on estrogen gel every day and progesterone tablets half a month and I can assure you it’s levelling me out and also helping out in the bedroom 😉\n\nAnd edit: please don’t take it personally that it’s you.

    "My (53m) wife(53f) has had a rough ride. She's estranged from most of her family for things that I agree deserve estrangement but someday could be resolved. \n\nShe has gotten into a mode where she wants to blow up those relationships forever by releasing some embarrassing information about her relatives that isn't widely known. She asked me what I thought and if menopause has taught me anything, she wants support more than she wants advice. \n\nSo despite my best judgment I asked some questions and ultimately told her to \"do whatever she thinks is best.\" I would prefer to let sleeping dogs lie. Guys that's not good enough. \n\nShe has been on the warpath because \"you're not a man if you don't want revenge for what they did to us.\" She's dropping all this you're a pussy if you turn the other cheek stuff when I just want harmony and peace. She wants war. She says I'm a \"slow learner\" and maybe I am. \n\nSome context, we have been together since we were 18. I grew up very poor and was raised to question authority and rewarded for independence. She grew up working class in an authoritarian household where she was punished if she didn't agree with her parents.we have built a successful life with a great career and comfortable retirement from nothing, we did it together and her support has made it possible.\n\nMy instinct is to ask questions, and get to the best answer the minds in the room can get to. Her instinct is that if I don't agree with her 100% then I am betraying her. \n\nIn the past we have been able to navigate this by giving and taking, but it feels like it's all or nothing now. \n\nI don't know what to do except to tell her what she wants to hear, as best I can guess it.  But I thought I was and it sucks to guess wrong. \n\nShe's on HRT but it isn't dialed in and she got some testosterone recently that I think is partly responsible. I was pretty salty when I started 18 years ago for an underlying medical condition.There's not a chance in hell I'm going to suggest it's her hormones. \n\nHave you navigated anything like this?  I have been trying to speak little and listen a lot but that seems to have run out for me.  ",

    "One more point. For me at least, when “women’s health” issues normally came up like menopausal per pregnancy etc. because I don’t not have close relationships with any of my female family members (my mom passed when I was in my early 20s) it makes you feel even more isolated and alone. Thru out  most of modern times women shared this type of I for thru the familial relationships. Neurodivergent women especially may have a hard time with this. And the phase makes it even worse. Like I’m a tender broken terrified little girl inside. And no one understands or knows what the hell is happening. Menopause was a very very rude surprise for me and most of my girl friends. And finally- I lost whatever mask (I’m AuDHD) I’d developed and cannot mask anymore. Menopause made me realize my sensitivities were actually neurological. As\nIn my neural tubes are shaped different. This is what neurodivergence is.\n\nIf she is neurodiverse this may be closer to who she actually is not what other people think she should be. Which could be another fulfilling. And exciting phase of your lives together. But will take a lot of patience and intentional empathy on both your parts.",
    "Its stinks this sub isn't more active because I just tried to get some information and resources on that sub and because I posted about my wife and I's frustration with our lack of sex since she went into menopause in the deadbedrooms sub about a month ago, they called me all kinds of names.  Ladies, we actually do care about you.  Not every man is evil.  Got some nice references and suggestions in the other sub but damn, its REALLY toxic to men. ",
    "Lurking perimenopause lady here.\n\nI'm sorry you got your head bitten off in the other sub!\n\nIf I may, the reason that probably happened is multi faceted:\n\n1. The biggest issue for a lot of women is not getting their mental and physical *anguish* acknowledged, let alone addressed when seeking help; however, as soon as our condition(s) affect a man's sex life suddenly we have to get the ol' girl back into shape! This is often a lifelong issue. I have endometriosis and adenomyosis. I was blown off for over 20 years. It wasn't until I met my husband, who is a literal saint, and he started coming with me to appointments that I was taken more seriously than take advil and, \"that's normal.\" Treatment didn't happen until they heard how hard my excruciating condition was *on him*. I'm not even kidding. \"No, you don't need pain meds or surgery.\" \"Please, my wife is unable to cook, clean, run carpool, work, or have sex with me.\" \"Ah, I see. Here's a rx and let's get that surgery on the books ASAP!\"\n\n2. We miss being as sexual! It's absolutely bizarre to rapidly get to a place where you want to want sex. It's not the same thing as an urge being removed. Then it's just absent from your life. But missing the urge for sex is an urge in and of itself. It's just an empty urge. I have always looked really young for my age. At 40 I was assumed to be in my mid to late 20s. Since having a hysterectomy and one ovary removed I've shot into perimenopause at 41. I still look much younger, but hot damn did I get older overnight! And it's happening still, and just so fast. It's difficult knowing that my skin isn't going to bounce back from the 17lbs I gained after surgery that I'm only finally able to start getting off (very fucking slowly and with SO MUCH effort, might I add). Google tortures me with \"memories\" of a young woman who had no clue how good she looked. I have to constantly remind myself that a future me will be saying the same thing about present me one day. \n\n3. Many women are faced with going from tons of unwanted attention from men all their lives to little attention to no attention around menopause years. It's hard to believe that your partner is turned on by you when you don't feel sexy yourself ... And no else seems to think you are either.\n\n4. We're so annoyed all the time. We are annoyed at our bodies for aging so quickly, we're annoyed at our once sharp minds turning to mush (seriously, I can't tell you how many times I am emphatically engaged in conversation only to literally forget the topic, the fucking entire TOPIC of conversation midsentence), we're annoyed at the misogynistic health care system, we're annoyed with work, we're annoyed with our kids for taking us for granted, we're annoyed with **you**.\n4a. We're annoyed with you for being a man\nb. We're annoyed with you for being able to sleep\nc. We're annoyed with you for your energy\nd. We're annoyed with you for not putting your damn underwear/dishes/keys/wallet/whatever the thing is in your relationship in the place it's supposed to be AGAIN!\ne. We're annoyed with you for not taking the time to be in it with us or we're annoyed with you for being too in it and treating us like children\n\n5. We're annoyed with you for not making us feel seen, connected, sexy and then coming to us for sex that we don't desire. Understand that sex in this era is going to be mostly connection based for her. Not physical. And, what's great about that is that the more you have sex the less the body loses in that department.\n\nIn conclusion, regarding the menopause sub AND your dicks: lead with what's going on with her and what's good for her and the rest will follow naturally. And, the kicker is that it has to be completely sincere. If you do the laundry and rub her feet while she bitches about work it can't be to get your dick wet. We're like pigs with truffles with that game. We'll smell it on you immediately.\n\nMy sincere recommendation for every partner of someone in perimenopause or menopause missing sex and wanting it back is to put it on the back burner for the moment and really dive into what it's like for her. Read up. Scroll through posts and the wiki, do a tiny amount of independent research. Ask her how it's been for her. Ask her if it's okay if you could go through this together and lean on each other more - which means that your feelings matter, too, and in a calm moment have a calm, rational conversation with each other about how it's been for you.\n\nIt's middle age! It's time to check the fuck back in with each other. Shit is going down. Crazy shit. Our parents are getting older or have passed, we're getting older (we're the reigning adults 😬). Our kids are growing up or have grown up. Our bones are getting brittle. Our entire place in the world, in the universe has shifted. Cling to each other. Share this shit. It's why we have partners in the first place. To go through life's trials together. She's going through it now and it affects everyone else around her. But, it is happening *to her*. There's no break. There's no escape valve. It's a lot.",

I hope I don't affend anyone. This is just my take...\n\nIt's like you are short circuiting moment by moment, day by day due to rapid hormone flucuations. Sometimes you get stuck in a funk that you just can't shake, and that goes on for weeks.\n\nThis is all because your ovaries are dying.\n\nYour body and brain are fighting to keep all the necessary sex hormones and neurotransmitters at optimal levels - that's why there are ups and downs.\n\nThe battle will be lost eventually though at the end of Perimenopause.\n\nFor a woman, aging unfortunately means that her ovaries shrivel up and die and her production of Progesterone and Estrogen die with them.\n\nEstrogen and Progestrone draw us to other people, and draws other people to us. And of course, we need proper functioning neurotransmitters to  properly connect with people.\n\nEstrogen, Progesterone, and also thyroid hormones affect the entire body, including the neurotransmitter levels in our brain. All of them eventually tank in late Perimenopause.\n\nIt would be like trying to run a car without ever changing the oil, and expecting it to run optimally. It will run, until it can't. Or trying to run a car with miss firing spark plugs. It will run, until it can't.\n\nIts not a choice, it's a condition Mother Nature has choosen for us.

    "My wife is 42 and was diagnosed in December with an aggressive form of BC that was thankfully early stage (Stage II hers+).  She had chemo and a double mastectomy.  Unsurprisingly, the chemo put her into menopause and its been awful for her.  Constant hot flashes, zero sex drive, vaginal atrophy, the works.  Will her body eventually adjust back to being somewhat \"normal\" again.  She hates that we can't have sex and I hate that whenever we attempt to have sex, my gal is wincing.  Just venting about how unfair this has been for her. ",
    "I went through it wife my wife. It changed her personality drastically--fits of rage, negativity towards me. she told me at one point that we were no longer going to have sex. We got through the chemo and radiation but it was all too much. She filed for divorce after treatment was over. I hate her oncologists to this day. They did nothing to prepare her or us for the massive changes that happened quickly. my two cents is to please see a psychiatrist together if possible. That treatment is for the health of the relationship, given all the other changes you will both face. \n\nI dont wish any of that on anyone. 😞",
    "(I am not a medical professional so take what I say with a grain of salt!)\n\n\nI think she may still be able to use localised vaginal estrogen to help the atrophy and pain. I dealt with that myself and it's so depressing and painful, I thought I would never have sex again.\n\n\nOna's shop online sells both estradiol and estriol creams. Estriol is the weakest estrogen, it's not systemic like estradiol, but incredible for dryness. It's also most likely the safest if she's unable to take any hormones. \n\n\nMost doctors are very very conservative when it comes to BC and HRT, understandably. However some doctors are not afraid to give very low doses. There is a book called Estrogen Matters that breaks down a lot of the myths surrounding HRT. I wonder if she would be able to have low dose testosterone? ",

    "Female here. Not dealing with the specific circumstances but was having issues with intercourse after a hysterectomy. Perhaps a pelvic floor therapist can help. Can she use vaginal estrogen?

    "My wife (48F) has been in peri for a couple of years (we think), but had it confirmed several months ago. The good thing is that you know what's going on!  Before we knew, I had no idea why she was sleeping all the time.  She thought she was getting arthritis in her joints (family history, so it makes sense), and she just wasn't thinking clearly all the time. Rather than take emotions out on me, she'd stuff them down I think.  Which made her seem really distant emotionally from me.  For me, I'd rather her have taken it out on me rather than just think I'd lost her.  I'll take drama over what I felt was indifference.  \n  \nI'l say that one month of HRT ( oral estrogen/progesterone) has made such a difference in how she feels. I can say the same thing about myself since starting TRT. We need the hormones we were designed to live with for proper bodily and mental function. I wouldn't listen to anyone (male or female) who discourages HRT/TRT.  They are out there, and they are loud (It's often older people who just want you to be as miserable as they are). For myself, I started feeling the decline, and decided I'm not going out like that.",
    "We were in a very similar situation, wife much older than me too. I’ll tell ya my wife sure does regret not getting on HRT sooner. Now she feels like a new woman. We also had a couple years there where sex was painful for her…def don’t let it get that far.",
    "Appreciate this subreddit to discuss this.\nI have questions:  how often do women in peri, who are not on HRT etc., feel in the mood for sex? What is “normal”?  I understand this will vary, but what’s a “baseline”?  \n\nMy wife is going through peri.  We had a good talk about it a couple of weeks ago. Having that talk was good for us.  Definitely for me as I understand much better what she’s going through and she knows that I understand (as best I can as a man) and care.  But I admit the lack of physical intimacy is getting to me.  I expressed this to her—not in a hurtful way, I said over and over that I am not angry but I feel “unwanted” and that doesn’t feel good.  I’m in a position now where I desire my wife, but I am not sure when the door is open to initiate.  I think she appreciates that I desire her. I tell her she’s beautiful, I try to be affectionate with her away from the bedroom in what people call “non-sexual” ways.  Over the past couple of years, I have made a concerted effort to contribute more in the house with things like doing the dishes, making the bed, etc.  I explained this to her, saying that I do these things because I know if I don’t that she will, and I want to take some stress off of her.  I know her level of anxiety has elevated the past couple of years, and I feel like the way I can help the most is to lower that anxiety level as much as I can.  \n\nBut again, how often are women who are going through peri in the mood for sex?  I wish she would talk to her doctor about HRT soon, but I want to be careful pushing that because it just sounds like I want to get her into bed (which i admit I do, but it’s a lot more than just that).  (My wife is 51F, I am 52M.)",

    "I am sad, frustrated, and broken hearted.  I dont know what to do anymore.  My wife and I are both 58, married for 34 years.  She says that she loves me, but she never shows me any affection. Because of issues related to menopause, we literally abstained from having sex for a few years.  I tried to rekindle our sex life, but she is doing everything she can to resist me.  She refuses to seek professional help.  I also discovered that I am now experiencing issues myself, but my wife does not want me to follow my doctor's recommendation involving prescriptions.  When we try to have sex, I tried to take my time with her so that she could enjoy it, but she keeps pushing me away.  Tonight, I want to talk to her to see where we both stand.  I am not sure how to approach this upcoming discussion.  I dont want a sexless marriage, but I also don't want to leave her, or go have an affair with another woman behind her back.  I could really use some advice right now.  Thank you all in advance...\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nSorry to take so long to give you an update, I wanted to wait a bit to see if anything significant happened since the initial posting, but that hasn't happened yet.  Thank you everyone for taking the time to write.  I really didn't get anywhere with our talk, no clear answers from her, but she seems willing to try to work things out.  We are not intimate as much as I would like to be, but I realize that I cant push it too much.  And when we do have intimacy, we try different things to see what works.  Its trial and error for now.  I am also considering what I am doing outside the bedroom; things like doing chores around the house (Yes, I do some chores, maybe I need to do more?) (She's not crazy about my cooking (yes, it sucks), she would rather do it (and she is a damn good cook, too!)).  I am keeping my fingers crossed.  As for the situation with my issues, I am looking to see if herbal remedies are more cost effective then the costly big pharma solutions.  ",
    "Is she on HRT or is she not treating her symptoms right now?",
    "I would go to the menopause subreddit and read everything in the wiki.",
    "Venting is good.  It is therapy in and of itself.  Don’t feel ashamed of how you feel.  \n\nNone of you guys should feel ashamed for wanting sex.  It’s biological.  \n\nHow you cope with this….it will be up to you.  Listen and learn and decide from there.",
    "I am sorry to say that I don’t know what the right answer is for you. \n\nI am 46F and took it upon myself to investigate and start HRT at the end of last summer after experiencing some frightening symptoms (non-sexual) that involved frequent heart palpitations and huge changes in heart rate while at rest. Plus overwhelming anxiety (think the kind you’d feel if an ax murderer was chopping down your front door to get into the house) and crippling insomnia. \n\nAlthough I was still having sex with my husband, sex was truly the last thing on my mind at that time. I was just trying to get through the day without either killing someone or having a nervous breakdown. \n\nI will say that this is our second marriage for both, so we are still in somewhat of a honeymoon phase. Also we were both in dead bedroom situations in our first marriages and have had many convos over the years about never letting our relationship get to that point. We both know what forced celibacy feels like and it’s awful. \n\nAfter a short time I really felt better overall and could then focus on sex. My husband who is also 46 started on twice weekly testosterone injections a few months after I began HRT. It has made a huge difference for him as well, not just sexually but in terms of overall motivation and drive to accomplish things at home and at work. \n\nIf this is really a meaningful problem for you (and I don’t judge you for that, I know how it feels) I would ask my wife to go to marriage counseling together. I would frame it maybe that you are missing the connection that you used to have. I would not explicitly mention sex until you and she have attended a few sessions together.\n\nGiven what some man-hating women here say, they truly don’t understand how critical sex is to a man in a relationship. I know it to be a huge part of how men feel accepted and loved. Most women can’t understand that due to the fact that most women can get sex anytime they want from almost anyone, and therefore for us it has nothing to do with acceptance. \n\nBest of luck!",
    "I would like to hear the wife’s perspective on all this. Was she happy before peri and menopause?\nOr was she already unhappy and is now waiting for an exit? Was the intimacy joyful or “dutiful”?\nPerhaps she can post on the other sub.\n\nFor many women, getting in the mood starts way before the bedroom, by having an attentive partner who truly cares about and for them without being asked or told what to do. Attention to wellbeing, cooking, household chores and mental load are a factor.\nAre you supporting her in the day-to-day in ways that she needs and are meaningful to her? Does she feel appreciated in her preferred love languages?\n\nThese would be questions to ask in your talk with her.",
    "Mate, I know it’s hard to see past sex from your own perspective - I get it - but the woman you’ve been married to for 34 frickin years is going through one of the biggest transitional events of her life and it sounds like she might be alone in this if your focus is just on your dick and not attempting to be a better partner. \n\nIs your wife your life partner or your sex doll? You need to zoom out from your penis, waaaay out, to get some perspective  on your marriage and start seeing her happiness and wellbeing and the strength of your relationship as priorities. Sex might come back if you are a man she’s proud to call her husband. Or the ick you’re giving her right now might become permanent. \n\nWe have no personal reference point for menopause. Our hormones have been steady from puberty and decline slowly and gently. If we gloss over this years-long event, we are doing a major disservice to our partners. Learn about this like it’s your job - which I argue it bloody well is. Order a menopause book and listen to a podcast and start to get some insight. \n\nI want my wife for life and I want her to want me for life. I will do everything in my power to be the best partner from her perspective because that’s what she’s doing for me.",
    "Sorry to hear about this situation. I hope this new subreddit helps with answers, especially from females. I guess there will be a lot of men eagerly waiting to see what the suggestions are. Best wishes.",
    "You're going to have to have some serious conversations about this.  It's completely unfair to force you into celibacy. The marriage agreement is monogamy, not celibacy.  At this stage in life, intimacy might not be PIV sex anymore.  That's OK. There are options.  But completely cutting you off from intimacy is simply unacceptable.  If she's refusing all professional (I assume medical) help, your situation is more dire. Have a conversation about how you can get sex without her. Many women decide they are done, and allow outside help as long as they don't know about it. This is WAY more common than you think.  You HAVE to let her know you aren't gong to live like this. It might end in divorce, and that might be what she actually wants anyway.",
    "This is really hard. My husband and I are in a dead bedroom too. we don’t even sleep in the same room anymore.  I have zero desire, despite HRT, and he can’t hold a boner anyway. It definitely takes a toll on the marriage, but only insofar as you prioritize it. We focus on other aspects of our marriage, as I’m sure you do, to keep us happy.\nMy advice is to remember that she’s going through a very real medical issue. It’s not by choice, in that the loss of libido and physical vaginal symptoms are very very real and she can’t just ignore them. In my case, I love my husband very much, and even want to have sex with him logically, but my body simply doesn’t respond, in fact, my body cringes at sexual touch. To make my case, I’ve always been highly sexual and usually the instigator in our relationship, so this isn’t at all a choice I’m in charge of. Imagine it like a pre pubescent child, before sex hormones…there’s just no thought or desire, and touch doesn’t feel sexy. That’s what it’s like once our hormones are depleted. \nSo, keep being supportive, talk to her about how much this affects you, and encourage her (without nagging) to get some help, and or both of you to have couples counseling to learn how to navigate this difficult transition. If she simply won’t get help, a good therapist can help you navigate this alone. In fact, if you start counseling over this, she might see how important it is to you and start doing something about it. Hope something changes for you. It’s really tough.",
    "Hi OP - I'm seeing this a bit late but I wanted to try to maybe bridge the gap between the two sides that seem to be fighting here. You have clearly stated that you don't want to leave her, so you are committed to trying to make things work. I'm very sorry to hear that she refuses to seek treatment like HRT. I wonder why that is, do you know? As others here said, she may be struggling with depression--if she isn't into HRT, maybe she would be willing to take something for that? I know the men of this group, for whom the group exists, won't like what I say next, but bear with me. What if you took a step back from talking about sex with her and focus for a while on anything else that may help her and perhaps ways you two could experience intimacy with your clothes on. I remember years ago at the end of a relationship I was in that I cringed when the man I had been with and lived with for several years even touched me. This wasn't me refusing him intimacy out of spite or punishment or lack of care for his feelings. That relationship ended, but it's not just that he didn't do it for me anymore. It's because there was a long list of other problems in our relationship that, on an affective level, made me not want to be intimate with him. It wasn't anyone's fault. But in your case I don't think this means the necessary end. You love her and you care about her and your marriage. You want and need this intimacy, and I bet that if she didn't feel so poor she would like that too. But when you said   \n\"When we try to have sex, I tried to take my time with her so that she could enjoy it, but she keeps pushing me away\" this tells me she needs your support in some way that maybe she hasn't been able to ask for yet.    \nIt's ok for you to have needs too, but you are committed to this relationship and she might just need to \\*feel\\* like you value her for things besides sex (I know you do, but she may not be able to see that right now). Coming back to intimacy with clothes on, I recommend a dance class--dance requires a certain kind of trust in the leading partner. I have taken a lot of classes with different partners--notably none of them were romantic, yet I felt a little something for each and every one of them! I know everyone is afraid that once sex has left the bedroom with will never come back. While it might look a little different, I don't think this has to be true, but you can't force it. Even if you are being gentle, she just might need something else right now.",
    "Let’s imagine that males of our species were the ones going through menopause and not the females. \n\nWould you as a man want to be dumped because your mind/body has changed through no fault of your own?\n\nDo you feel comfortable with your wife having an affair if your sex parts longer work?\n\nAfter 34 years of marriage your wife decides to leave you because you can’t get it up?  \n\nOr, sex causes you pain and discomfort, tearing, dryness of your penis. \n\nYou are aware of interventions but they aren’t for you for one reason or another so she’s dumping you. \n\nDo you understand the difference between intimacy and sex?

    "i hope you don’t mind yet another post by a woman. i suspect while this sub is in its infancy stage, more women may come here to willingly help by offering advice or share stories and information.\n\nwhat i want to share today is that many of us *do* realize that this whole phase of life is not easy on our partners, families, and friends. while women are going through this, there are often no words to describe how they’re feeling, or what exactly is wrong today. i have crying spells, for instance, that come out of thin air. nothing is wrong, i’m not sad or thinking about anything sad, my husband didn’t say anything; *NOTHING HAPPENED*. i’m just…crying for no reason at all, and then it passes. my sweetheart of a husband is in a land of distress when this happens, and i dare say he doesn’t believe me when i say that nothing is wrong. but truly, *nothing is wrong*. my hormones are off kilter and they are literally leaking out of my eyeballs instead of acting out in another way. to be honest, i’d rather just cry for no reason than feel instant rage for no reason. \n\nnot to say that there’s times when something *is* wrong, and in those instances, i share with him what’s bothering me. i try very hard to make sure i communicate with him how i’m feeling, so that he can rule himself out. it’s important to me that he knows this has nothing to do with him; my body is turning against me and i simply can’t control some of the things i say or do. \n\nwhen perimenopause started for me, the mood changes came first. we could be watching a movie together, and i’d just be *angry* for no reason out of nowhere. he didn’t do anything to prompt it. but if he said something, maybe just about the movie, i’d be likely to retort with anger, and of course, he’d be confused, like, “What did I say…? I just asked if that was the same actor that’s in the series we’re watching…” and i’d realize there was no reason for me to be rude or shitty about it. as this started happening more and more (mood swings), i began distancing myself when i felt out of sorts, so that i wouldn’t bite his head off. i’d go to the basement or sit outside or go to the bedroom. and he’d get concerned and *follow* me, asking questions, wanting to know what he said or did. he was often relentless in demanding to know what my problem was and this sparked arguments, because following me did nothing but make me angrier and feel trapped when i just wanted to take some space to sort myself out.\n\nnow he knows when i leave the room abruptly or just say, “Hey, I’m going to go downstairs/outside for a bit”, that i *need* to be alone. i sincerely love him and appreciate that he’s concerned about me, but i don’t want to hang my bad mood on anyone, especially the man i love so much. he *finally* got that, and it took some time for him to comprehend that i’m not walking out on *us*; i’m walking out on this bad mood. \n\nthis phase is *scary* and full of things i never had before, like anxiety and depression. i’m not the same fun and wild woman he started dating and eventually married. i remember her; she was fun and happy and pretty damn cute. she didn’t have a spare tire around her tiny waist and she was a cougar in the sack…the woman i am now is in constant change. i barely recognize my reflection. if there’s any Dragonball Z fans reading this, think about Cell and his forms. i’m Imperfect Cell, and this is an *ugly* phase. maybe someday i’ll make it to my final form, and i’ll be much, much better.\n\nso, i guess the moral to this post is, give her some space, and don’t poke the bear. let her know you’re there if she needs you, but let her go when she needs to go. we seriously cannot control some of the ill feelings, thoughts, and moods we’re having, and we don’t want to hurt the ones around us. some of the shit that comes out of our mouths is horrible and is so uncalled for and hurtful. no doubt we’ll be crying about it later and telling you we did not mean those words. please know we don’t, and that we need you more than ever at this trying time in life.\n\nif you read all this, *THANKS SO MUCH*. ✌️\n\n",

    "52m here. I've been on TRT for almost 5 years. My levels were at the low end of normal for a 47 year old. Around 300ng/dl. I take my health seriously, eating healthy, and working out. No, I'm not a body builder per say, and no one would ever mistake me for one. I'm fit. People refer to me as looking fit, not muscular.  My wife was very supportive of my decision to try TRT. She saw the mood swings, low libido, sleeplessness,  and frustration over making very little gains in the gym for someone working so hard. 6 months ago the TRT I was on(the gel)stopped working, and my levels dropped to 48ng/dl. That is insanely low for an otherwise healthy 51m. So now it's injections, and the numbers are much better. I feel stronger, and am carrying more muscle, and have my energy back. My wife has been suffering with peri-menopause for about 2 years now, and while various medications have helped, she has not yet tried HRT. She has suffered so much, and it has negatively affected both our lives. Once she's been on the new meds for a while, she will discuss HRT with her doctor again. I hope we can get our lives back.

It also doesn’t have the wild swings as the brain and ovaries try to work out wtf happening. Not to say he won’t feel the effects of declining testosterone or benefit from supplementation. Blood tests are easy to interpret. Testosterone supp is also relatively easy to get in most countries. \n\nIf it’s just testosterone dropping with age, it just feels like the engine could do with a tune, like you can but don’t really want to do the regular activities anymore, maybe a creeping feeling that something is wrong and hasn’t been found yet, a little down and unsure, less confident. A little soggy around the middle. Still interested in sex… but not with the same intensity. Told doc, got on gel next day, right as rain. Pretty straightforward. I know some mates got pretty depressed and went on ADs instead of testosterone though. I think they would have benefited from testosterone but I also don’t know if they had other stuff going on. \n\nNothing like wife’s complicated full-body-brain experience. We had no clue what was happening to her but neither did her doctor. Multiple doctors actually. What a head fuck. Took years to work it out and I was furious with them medical system for failing her so completely. She lost her job and a bunch of friends. Things were tense between us but we were and still are solid. Still trying to get back on track. We are both late 40s. \n\nGiven how straightforward the testing and supplementation process is, I wouldn’t waste time on any more research tbh. Tell him he needs to make an appointment with his doc and let him sort it out.",
    "I’m a wife in peri and can tell you about my husband’s symptoms of low T. We are both turning 47 this year.\n\nWhat it comes down to is that he was exhibiting multiple signs of depression.\n\nHe lacked motivation to tackle projects around the house that he previously was very driven to complete and would take on without any prompting from me. \n\nHe was drinking too much beer, and basically sofa-rotting when not at work. This was very different behavior for him, a marked change from 5-6 years ago. \n\nHe just seemed angry, sad and tired. \n\nI started HRT myself last August and made an appt for him with the same provider. He started T injections a couple months later and almost immediately improved. It took some time tinkering with dose to find the sweet spot, which is normal. But he’s mostly back to his charming, funny self.",
    "Daft question but how do guys know if they may be lacking in hormones in the first place?  The lack of knowledge works both ways as my husband has learned the same time as me about my menopause symptoms apart from the stereotypical standing in front of an open fridge 😄",
    "Hey, the r/trt sub is a bit better than the r/testosterone sub for this.  The big testosterone sub contains some TRT talk, but it's open to all kinds of doses and substances.\n\nI'd be open to talking about it here.\n\nBut beware, your husband might turn into a gym bro. ;) Testosterone is magical stuff if you can get on the right dosage for your body.",
    "I don’t think TRY for men is apples to apples when comparing wjth the experience of women.  Men take T and it just works.  For us ladies…it helps but doesn’t fix it.  \n\nReplacing T at the same time a woman is going through meno…perhaps is setting yourselves up for an even bumpier ride.  \n\nHe feels on top of the world and she feels barely ok.  \n\nPerhaps men losing some T was a process that was supposed to happen in order to preserve relationships.  \n\nJust putting it out there.  \n\nI’m certainly not anti TRT.  Just pointing out what a complicated mess aging is for a couple that just trying to enjoy the so called “golden years”",
    "I'm a menopausal woman, happy to see this space for you lucky men who get to live with us! I thought I'd help some of you out by sharing the phases of menopause. \n\nPre-menopause: this is the period of life after a young woman begins her period/puberty and ends with the first symptoms of peri-menopause. This stage lasts around 30-35 years, though can vary significantly if health issues are involved. \"Normally\" begins around 10-15 years old ends around 40-45 years old. \n\nPeri-menopause: is the period when a woman's estrogen and progesterone begins dwindling. This stage on average lasts 4 years, but can last anywhere from a few months up to about 15 years. This stage is where most women will have the most symptoms. She is still menstruating, but her  cycle will start changing as she draws closer to the end of her menstruating life. Typical age for peri-menopause is 40-50. It is not uncommon though to start seeing symptoms in late 30's. If she is still menstruating but showing symptoms, she's in peri-menopause. \n\nMenopause: this phase lasts exactly one day. It is the day that marks 12 months from her last period. Average age 51, though it can certainly come much earlier or later.\n\nPost-menopause: this phase begins the day after menopause, and remains for the rest of her life. For some women, there will be a big relief of symptoms, for others, symptoms remain or even begin. Average age 51 + one day. This phase can come much sooner or much later for different women. Anything prior to 45 is considered early menopause. Surgery, like a full hysterectomy can bring any aged women into post-menopause. \n\nIt is not at all uncommon that the word \"menopause\" or \"menopausal\" will be used to cover both peri and post menopause phases. Women lately and  colloquially might refer to their symptoms as \"Perry\"...like, \"Perry came over and won't let me sleep\" \n\nHope this helps! \n",
    "My wife is in the peri-menopausal(48) stage, and it's absolutely awful for her. Migraines. Nausea. Lightheadedness. Brain fog. She was able to see a neurologist and was given medication, which helped a lot for about 8 months, and it's like it just stopped working. She's now on another medication, and after almost 3 weeks, it seems to be helping. She was offered HRT, but turned it down. Some days she can't go to work, and can't drive. She's worried about losing her job and her employer has a no remote work policy.  I've done everything I can, and now feel pretty usess while she suffers.",
    "Woman in peri here: I just shared this sub wifh my husband.",
    "This is great except for one thing: peri can begin a decade or more before actual menopause. For a lot of people, it will be marked with a surprise weight gain, sudden musculoskeletal symptoms like a new knee or hip problem, or new onset mood or anxiety disorders. These things may start several years before menstrual cycle fluctuations!",
    "So I have a question about:\n\n&gt;Post-menopause: this phase begins the day after menopause, and remains for the rest of her life. **For some women, there will be a big relief of symptoms, for others, symptoms remain or even begin.**\n\nFor those that don't get a relief of symptoms, and the symptoms remain or begin, is it for life?",
    "I created this subreddit to give mutual support to people helping and living alongside a partner who is experiencing perimenopause, the full blown menopause and post menopausal life.\n\nThis can be the sharing of symptoms, a place for us to let off steam or to give advice.",
    "This is long overdue.  I really hope you guys get some traction.  \n\nThe non judgmental part is most needed.  I’ve seen so many men vilified for just trying to understand this process that no one expected or wanted.  \n\nI count myself as one of the few women that can see that you guys are hurting too.  \n\nMake a community.  I think it can help heal.",
    "Good luck! People who are with their partners for better for worse in sickness and in health NEED support. Sure peri/menopause isn’t cancer or progressive dementia, but it can be really rough both the person experiencing it and the people around them. \n\nI hope that this space won’t degenerate into another “get a divorce!” “Women suck” space like so many do.",
    "Thank you thank you thank you. \n\nIdk why the main thread was so icy towards men asking serious questions, shit, even asking specific questions for my wife I was either blatantly ignored or verbally attacked. \n\nGlad to be here!",
    "i’m so proud of you for doing this! my husband is 11 years younger than me and he has been my rock through everything. but i read so many horrible stories about hateful and unwilling to learn or care partners on the menopause sub and realize how fortunate i am to have him. i want men to be able to grasp at least a little of why their partner is struggling and how to help her out. i want you to have a place to vent, to ask questions, to seek advice, without the hostility you may face on the menopause sub. \n\nit means so much that you cared enough to start this, and i wish you all the best in the world. i will spread the word for you, good sir. thank you so much and god speed! ✌️❤️",
    "After defending a guy genuinely trying to ask questions on the menopause subreddit I’m happy to see you created this.  😊",
    "Hi. I’m a woman in peri and I am here to lend support and provide education to those seeking that with an open mind and heart. I hope this stays a positive space, and I’m willing to help with that. My husband has been amazing so hopefully I can pay that forward.",
    "I hope kind women will visit here to help too.  I've read some really frustrating things on the main sub that make me just feel dread about it coming for my (perimenopausal) wife. It's not uncommon to read  posts that essentially say, \"I've become an asshole, and I love it!  This is the real me now!\". How is that what anyone aspires to be?",
    "Ty.  My wife is going through menopause due to chemo from breast cancer and the women on the other subreddit were terrible to me when I just tried to ask a question about what was going on with my partner.  Hopefully both men and women contribute here.",
    "Excellent idea",
    "I think this is great. A place for men to ask questions (in good faith) and receive support is important for all involved.",
    "I’ve seen some of the negative comments on the menopause sub… I personally feel this can be a good thing for other halves, especially as IMO men traditionally don’t talk as much as they maybe should with what bothers them, mental health etc. My husband also feels at times he needs a shield of steel and a crystal ball, or a gag for me 😄 and it’s a shame he’s not on Reddit (also love how this sub is a ‘shed’ 😄)",
    "[deleted]",
    "Thank you for creating this! It's truly frustrating the way so many partners are treated on the main sub. I'm a woman and I've joined and will happily offer advice and not yell at anyone 🤣 ❤️",
    "My wife told me to join this subreddit...",
    "Man, I thought the body armor and crystal ball was funny. And I'm in perimenopause WITH PMDD (and in luteal phase, might I add).\n\nI'm primed to be offended and irritated and I wasn't.\n\nI'm glad you created this page.\n\nMy hope is that it will follow in the lines of the PMDD partners sub. They hold space for the partners who need to come on and vent - but, they are absolutely partners who are loving and dedicated to the afflicted partner.\n\nGuess what those of us who are the afflicted partner need? Space for our families to complain and be heard, too. Humor is also a wonderful tool.\n\nMy husband and I would be in a much different place if we didn't share humor in this nightmare.\n\nEdit: clarity",
    "I think this is an excellent idea and as a perimenopausal woman married to a wonderful man who tries his best to understand and support me, I really appreciate what you’re doing here.",
